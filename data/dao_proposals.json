Specifically, it calls for the following additions:\n\n* Aggregation protocol is expanded to include derivatives \n* Add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts, 1inch dApp, and 1inch API \n* The first derivative supported will be Opium\u2019s TURBO products (call options)\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal aims to signal to the 1inch Foundation that the DAO wants to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol \u2013 specifically, the 1inch smart contracts, the 1inch dApp, and the 1inch API. Adding derivative aggregation to the protocol will require technical effort from 1inch Labs, and will require the support of 1inch Foundation. \n\n## Motivation\n\n1inch is currently the leading decentralized exchange aggregator and has made a reputation of providing the best prices on token swaps. With the rise of derivatives in the DeFi space, there is a new product niche that 1inch is perfectly positioned to capitalize on: **the aggregation of derivative products.** \n\nBy implementing this proposal, 1inch will solve the problem of fractured derivative liquidity (just like it previously solved fractured token liquidity). \n\n## Specification \n\nThis proposal serves as a signal from the 1inch Network DAO to the 1inch Foundation and 1inch Labs. Once passed, the 1inch Network DAO calls for the 1inch Foundation to allot resources to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch Protocol and dApp, and for 1inch Labs to add derivative aggregation to the 1inch smart contracts and 1inch API.\n\nOpium\u2019s TURBO product is a short-dated call option:\n\n* Community \/ users can \u201cwrite\u201d covered calls by pooling their tokens in order to earn yield (collect call option premiums)\n* Takers (professional market makers) can buy the call options in order to gain leveraged exposure to the underlying asset\n\nAdding Opium\u2019s TURBO options to the aggregation UI will require coordination with the Opium community to ensure a smooth integration.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe architecture of the aggregation protocol has not yet been defined. \n\nOpium\u2019s TURBO product was chosen as the first derivative supported because the Opium community was offering to help with this integration via documentation and SDKs.\n\n## Considerations\n\nThe specifics of launching an aggregation protocol will not be defined until the 1inch Foundation supports the proposal. Like all new modules they have launched, a complete security review and audit should be performed before this change is implemented on mainnet. \n\nSince all work described in this proposal will be organized by the 1inch Foundation, this will not cost any treasury funds.","protocol":"1inch","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xA8Ed85b1d441Da00270eCc6dc3600f3CBa9D4A03","totalVotes":35,"blockNumber":14113944,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/1inch.eth\/proposal\/0x5f0d629bc534471f9ec7b0d91e86be8eb4c1a3df4e19167976d7985589f90a39","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643639734}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644244534}","startTimestamp":1643639734,"endTimestamp":1644244534,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For the proposal', 'Against the proposal']","results":"[{'total': 32569098, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Replace with a deflationary mechanism.\n\n## Motivation\nThis eliminates sell pressure from the stakers as well, and everybody is incentivised as the supply decreases = more valuable\u2026 Holders will be more committed to hold the token, instead of farming\/staking and then selling the token, which decreases the value of the token.\n## Specification \nRemoving Single-Asset-Staking & Farming Completely. Replace with a mechanism where users stake $1INCH tokens and get incentivised to access governance + instead of receiving rewards, the stakers will collectively help burn $1INCH tokens (deflationary pool). Deflationary pool which users will stake their $1INCH and will determine the burn speed\/rate. Essentially the traditional staking rewards will now go into a deflationary pool and get burnt.\n\n## Benefits\nThe main benefit is that the community basically decides the burn rate, the more people who stake $1inch tokens the more it will be deflationary. If in any case, less people stake, the burn rate will slow down significantly, so it\u2019s continuously up to the 1inch holders for it to be as deflationary as they want it. It empowers holders more, and takes rewards away from \u201cwhale\u201d holders. It is evident that most people who stake\/farm usually dump the token which currently plays a significant role in the tokens value. With this mechanism, you can have the best of both worlds, making it \u201cstake-to-burn\u201d rewards HOLDERS. It encourages more value to the token.\n\n## Drawbacks\nA potential drawback could be that some people may be upset in regards to removing staking \/ farming, especially the single asset staking. In the long term this is actually very healthy for the 1inch ecosystem. We need to start building 1inch\u2019s future now. The distribution on 1inch currently in my opinion is successful, very successful in fact. But the staking is really decreasing the token value.\n\nImagine if it was deflationary but still rewarding holders.","protocol":"1inch","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x7A40f8d50C926417437A37fed26044e8C8384515","totalVotes":104,"blockNumber":12938607,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/1inch.eth\/proposal\/QmU5rSEMyb9qpPqWUoaJBoTiH6XjBknnojUsXirFxeRjHr","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1627826400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1628431200}","startTimestamp":1627826400,"endTimestamp":1628431200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['I am in favour of this proposal', 'Against the change']","results":"[{'total': 93660.55, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2780.7017, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Platform Fees Reduction for those who are staking 1inch in the DAO proportional to the amount of tokens that have been staked.\n\n2. Platform Fees Reduction for Achieving Certain Personal Total Trading Volume + Trading milestones on 1inch DEX\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Feature is used by Many Centralized Exchanges like Binance etc. But when it comes to DEX there's not Much Competition .\n\n1inch DEX on other Hand is one of the Best DEX out there & can take advantage of Such Implementation which will help the Project to move in new directions & Compete against Centralized Exchanges & with other DEX'es as well .\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Platform Fees Reduction for those who are **staking 1inch** in the DAO proportional to the amount of tokens that have been staked [For 1inch Stakers]\n*Note: The exact ratio can be voted on*\n\n#### **Specific example for a 1:1 fee reduction for 1inch staked:**\n\nAnton stakes 2000 1inch tokens in the DAO\n1inch price = $5\n2000 * $5 = $10,000\n\nThis means that Anton has a 100% fee* reduction on trades >= $10,000 in value.\n\n\n2.

Hard Lock - in   : Tokens unlocks only after full period ends .\n     2. Liquid Lock - in : Provides flexibility & Tokens Unlock slowly with time .\n\n       Note: The length of time can be voted on\n\n- 1inch LP - If Trader don't Want to Stake they can also Provide Liquidity to Top 5 1inch Liq. Pools\n\n##  Trading Useless Shitcoins for Fee Reduction\n**Possible Solution**\n\nGranting Fee Reduction on Approved Pools & Tokens at 1st & then Gradually opening it to other well known tokens too by Voting etc .\n\n##  Top [$1INCH](https:\/\/twitter.com\/1inch) holders may have more advantages when collecting Trading Discount than others .\n\n**Possible Solution**\n\nIf you collect discount more than 10% of current DFC allocation  , **30%** of it will be used to buy back [$1INCH](https:\/\/twitter.com\/1inch) at the market price & Redistribute them immediately to Governance Stakers etc. .

{"refId":"cHJvcG9zYWw6YWF2ZTpkZWZhdWx0OjU2","id":"56","title":"Add Assets to Aave Polygon Market and Update WMATIC Risk Parameters","content":"\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP would list BAL, CRV, DPI, GHST, LINK, and SUSHI from the AAVE V2 market on the Aave Polygon Market, and list GHST as a new asset to the Polygon market as collateral. WMATIC risk parameters are also being updated.\n\n## Rationale\n\nBAL, CRV, DPI, LINK, and SUSHI have been voted in by governance to be added to the Polygon market. These tokens are already listed in the V2 market.\n  \nWMATIC parameters are being updated to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGHST is the token that powers the Aavegotchi universe. Aavegotchi (Playable DeFi-backed NFTs) utilizes Aave aTokens in game as collateral assets for Aavegotchis \u201cplayable bank\u201d. Given Aave\u2019s recent launch onto Polygon (where Aavegotchi is deployed) the Aavegotchi community believes it would be a great idea to have GHST token as collateral on Matic Aave. If GHST gets listed as an collateral on Aave, users of Aavegotchi will be able to use aGHST as collateral within their Aavegotchis.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the availability of cross chain governance, it's time to make long overdue updates to the Polygon market.\n\n## Specifications\n  \nThe risk parameters for the assets coming from the V2 market to the Polygon market are as follows:\n\n#### BAL\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n#### CRV\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n#### DPI\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%\n- Not borrowable\n#### LINK\n- LTV: 50%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 65\n- Liquidation Bonus: 7.5%\n- Reserve Factor: 10%\n#### SUSHI\n- LTV: 20%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 10%\n- Reserve Factor: 35%\n- Not borrowable\n\n## Adding GHST to the Polygon Market\n\n1. Aavegotchis are crypto-collectibles (NFT). Aavegotchis are pixelated ghosts living on the Matic blockchain, backed by the ERC-721 standard. Their value is determined by rarity level 2, which is calculated via multiple factors, such as base traits, amount of staked collateral 2, and equipped wearables. GHST token is the backbone of Aavegotchi Realm. GHST is an in-game asset, used in all operations in-game (excluding usage of GHST as a collateral for summoning your Aavegotchi, which are aTokens powered by Aave) such as buying portals (opened\\closed), wearable items, potions and etc.\n\n2. Users of Aavegotchi will borrow GHST, to use it as an in-game asset, to speculate on in-game values or for other in-game purposes. Users of Aavegotchi will use it as a collateral to summon their gotchis with it because aTokens are another backbone of the game. To summon your Aavegotchi you need to have a specific amount of aTokens to make it possible.\n\n3. GHST token has been live on Ethereum Mainnet since September, when it was launched via a continuous bonding curve DAICO sale (still live today at aavegotchi.com\/curve 5). The token was launched at 0.2 DAI \/ GHST and currently sits at around 1.2 DAI. The all-time high is around 1.9 DAI \/ GHST. GHST is priced in DAI because unlike most tokens in crypto, it is actually backed by a DAI reserve at a 33% connecting weight. This makes the price more stable because it takes more in\/out to change the price.\n\nA significant challenge for Aavegotchi as a project was deciding to migrate our ecosystem from Ethereum to Polygon (then known as Matic). Expensive gas fees would have made it impossible for our players to use Aavegotchi NFTs (which require constant onchain attention). However, from January to March, we were able to complete the migration and launch successfully onto Polygon.\n\n4. GHST is the official utility token of the Aavegotchi ecosystem and can be used to purchase portals, wearables, and consumables.\n\n5. The inflation of GHST tokens through purchases on the bonding curve is positively correlated to the GHST price. The bonding curve has been mathematically programmed to increase the price of GHST as the circulating supply of GHST increases.\n\n6. The bonding curve has minting and burning permissions, but these permissions are governed by the AavegotchiDAO which exists on Ethereum Mainnet. GHST tokens are not arbitrarily minted or burned. The supply is determined by inputs via the bonding curve.\n\n#### Market Data\n\n- Market Cap - \\$140,000,000\n- 24hr Trading volume - \\$29,209,070\n- Currently listed on 14 exchanges: Binance, Okex, Poloniex, Uniswap, Gate.io, LBank, Bilaxy, Hoo, MXC, BiBox, 0x, BamBoo Relay, QuickSwap, 1ich Exchange;\n- Maturity - 15 months.\n\n#### Proposed Risk Parameters\n- LTV: 25%\n- Liquidation Threshold: 45%\n- Liquidation Bonus: 12.5%\n- Reserve Factor: 20%  \n  \n#### Socials\n\n- Telegram group: - Telegram: Contact @aavegotchi 8 - 12,000+ members;\n- Discord - https:\/\/discord.gg\/aavegotchi 16,000+ members\n- https:\/\/twitter.com\/aavegotchi - twitter 67,000 followers;\n- Active forum https:\/\/dao.aavegotchi.com\/\n- Governance Snapshot https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aavegotchi.eth\n- Active code development - https:\/\/github.com\/aavegotchi\n\n#### Token Stats\n\n- Contract\u2019s date of deployments: 14 September 2020 (Ethereum)\n- Number of transactions:\n  - Ethereum: 143,397\n  - Polygon: 2,507,992\n- Number of holders for tokens:\n  - Ethereum: 6,427\n  - Polygon: 68,943\n- Currently circulating Supply - 66,419,514\n- Current total supply - 66,419,514\n\n#### Full Disclosure\n\nStani Kulechov is an official advisor of Aavegotchi, and Aave has invested into Pixelcraft Studios, the development team behind Aavegotchi.\n  \n## WMATIC Risk Parameter Update\n  \nThe criteria for assessing market risk, as determined by the market size and changes in fluctuation in demand, is presented by the Aave community here. In line with the criteria, analysis of the MATIC token on Polygon network is presented below:\n\n|Holders:|168,102|B+ to A-|B+|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Transactions|100,240,631|A||\n|Mkt Cap|586,568,252|B+ to A-||\n|Av.

However, the volatility score of B- (C+ to B-) is justified by the 0.06579 score compared to 0.064 in the table presented in the documentation 1. Further to this, assets like BAL and BAT on Ethereum have similar vol characteristics to wMATIC on Polygon. The Norm.

If user behavior and market conditions over the coming months continue to show safe conditions for increasing capital efficiency on FEI, we shall recommend ramping up the LTV and Liquidation Threshold incrementally.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZmvleUX.png)\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\n[Forum Discussion](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2022-01-14\/6942).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).\n","protocol":"aave","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x683a4F9915D6216f73d6Df50151725036bD26C02","totalVotes":5,"blockNumber":14030921,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 14030921}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 14050121}","startTimestamp":1642527423,"endTimestamp":1642784225,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['NAY', 'YAE']","results":"[{'total': 441747.97, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 14052638}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1642817961}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 14059558}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1642910003}]"}

In addition, we propose freezing the KNCL reserve.\n\n\n## Abstract\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the the [Moderate risk level](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aave.eth\/proposal\/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi) chosen by the Aave community. These parameter updates are a continuation of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe recent market downturn on the weekend of December 4th led to the most liquidations on both centralized exchanges and in liquidity protocols in the recent past. Most liquidations on the Aave protocol happened between 4:30 and 5:45 UTC when the price of ETH dropped nearly 13%. Below is a graph of liquidation by collateral and repay asset.\n![Liquidations by collateral and repay asset](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gDTtU13.png)\nAlthough volatility for assets is slightly higher, the abundance of liquidity and active market participants is a positive sign for the health of Aave! For example, the total value of CRV (curve dao token) liquidated was large compared to the total collateral used on Aave. Lower LTV, lower liquidation threshold, and higher liquidation bonus protect the protocol from insolvencies. However, multiple liquidations of over 400,000 USD occured in quick succession. This shows ample liquidity for liquidators even in times of high network congestion. These market events provide important data points for measuring tail risk.\n\nFor reference, previous analysis of liquidations on Aave from May 2021 can be found here: https:\/\/medium.com\/gauntlet-networks\/aave-protocol-liquidation-retrospective-may-2021-67c655fc1b31\n\nAlthough some assets currently have higher volatility, our analysis shows that it is safe to increase borrowing parameters and decrease liquidation bonus values. Our simulations study price drops and network congestion more extreme than was seen last week, and slippage and liquidity considerations have improved.\n\n| Parameter | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| BAT Loan To Value     | 70%     | 75%     |\n| CRV Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |\n| ENJ Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 7.5%     |\n| REN Loan To Value     | 55%     | 60%     |\n| REN Liquidation Threshold     | 60%     | 65%     |\n| SNX Loan To Value    | 30%     | 40%     |\n| SNX Liquidation Threshold    | 55%     | 60%     |\n| SUSHI Liquidation Bonus    | 10.0%     | 8.5%     |\n| ZRX Loan To Value    | 60%     | 65%     |\n\n**Freezing KNCL**\nThe KyberDAO approved the proposal to [migrate KNC token contract](https:\/\/github.com\/KyberNetwork\/KIPs\/blob\/master\/KIPs\/kip-6.md) to a new implementation on 4\/20, which enables Kyber governance to upgrade KNC efficiently. As of 11\/2, 177M of KNC have migrated to the new [Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/7bcba345f687a2f1456f5edd9ce97202) and 74M of KNC are still in the old [KNC Legacy (KNCL) contract](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/2e2928dea5f71b9825b8b646686bd200). There is currently 916K KNCL supply and 229k total borrowed on Aave.\n\nConsidering that exchanges (e.g. [Kraken](https:\/\/support.kraken.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/4401758213268-Kyber-KNC-token-migration), [Crypto.com](https:\/\/blog.crypto.com\/crypto-com-supports-the-kyber-network-knc-token-migration\/)) have stopped supporting KNCL deposit and trading, the liquidity of KNCL has also been reduced. We propose freezing KNCL to speed up the KNC migration as well as eliminating the risk of keeping a less liquid deprecated asset on the platform.\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\n\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Risk Dashboard](https:\/\/gov.gauntlet.network\/aave) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Aave V2. \n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UV96hoq.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe proposal sets the liquidation bonus, LTV and liquidation threshold ratios by calling `configureReserveAsCollateral` on the `LendingPoolConfigurator` contract at `0x311Bb771e4F8952E6Da169b425E7e92d6Ac45756`, using the address and parameters specific to each token.\n\nThe full list of parameter updates can be found in the [forum](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/arc-risk-parameter-updates-2021-12-16\/6646).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).\n","protocol":"aave","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x683a4F9915D6216f73d6Df50151725036bD26C02","totalVotes":10,"blockNumber":13845810,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13845810}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13865010}","startTimestamp":1640052567,"endTimestamp":1640310831,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['NAY', 'YAE']","results":"[{'total': 394075.5, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13877253}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1640474091}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13869103}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1640364890}]"}

The two quarter pilot program had a grants budget of $1 million and an operating budget of $250,000 per quarter. The pilot program has awarded $1.17m to 38 grant recipients and made the initial steps to put the grants process and the protocol in the hands of the community.\n\nMoving forward we propose renewing Aave Grants DAO with an increased grants budget of $2 million and an operations budget of $2 million per quarter. With the increased budget we will increase the number of larger community grants, fund non-developer grants including sponsorship and community events, and work to decentralize the grants process.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAGD\u2019s mission is to build a thriving ecosystem of contributors for Aave. We provide grants to projects, ideas, and events that benefit Aave and its ecosystem. We hope to be at the forefront of ecosystem development at Aave.

It basically turns Uniswap V3s liquidity positions into Uniswap v2 like ERC20 tokens. \n\nTwo G-UNI Pools have been deployed with Uniswap V3 Positions in highly concentrated ranges (centered around 1:1) on the 0.01% fee tier of both DAI\/USDC and USDC\/USDT markets. Add liquidity to these pools and earn auto compounded LP fees on these high volume uniswap v3 stablecoin pairs, just by holding the G-UNI LP Token. Because of the fungible nature of these G-UNI tokens which represent proportions of a shared Uniswap V3 position, they are a simple solution for lending and borrowing markets to onboard Uniswap V3 LP as a collateral type.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBased on several discussions with Aave stakeholders and Uniswap v3 Liquidity providers, we believe that the G-UNI DAI \/ USDC and USDC \/ USDT pool tokens would provide great value to Aave users as an efficient way of utilizing their USDC, DAI and USDT collateral to borrow other tokens while earning compounding trading fees on Uniswap v3. Moreover, this would enable Aave users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide and thus significantly increase their fees earned.\n\n## Specifications\n\n1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?\n\nGelato is the development team behind G-UNI\n\n2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token\n\nThe token is a wrapper around stablecoin pairs on Uniswap v3, it only uses Gelato\u2019s network of keepers to automate fee compounding\n\n3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?\n\nG-UNI would enable Aave users to go leverage on their Uniswap v3 positions and potentially 50x the liquidity they provide and thus significantly increase their fees earned.\n\n4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?\n\nG-UNI was deployed to Mainnet in June 2021 and since then projects such as Instadapp, MakerDAO, Float and Rari have integrated it. We worked a lot to understand the inner mechanism of Uniswap v3 and did 2 external audits to ensure the smart contracts we are using are secure.\n\n5. How is the asset currently used?\n\nAs Collateral in MakerDAO or for Liquidity mining incentives in projects such as Float or Fei for example.\n\n6. Emission schedule\n\nNo emission\n\n7. Token (& Protocol) permissions (minting) and upgradability. Is there a multisig? What can it do? Who are the signers?\n\nAll pools will be immutable, as the upgradability key will or already has been burned.\n\n8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)\n\nVolume corresponds to the volume of DAI, USDC and USDT on Uniswap v3\n\n9. Social channels data (Size of communities, activity on Github)\n\nOver 20k on Twitter and 16k on Telegram\n\n10. Contracts date of deployments, number of transactions, number of holders for tokens\n\nDeployed quite recently, around 50 transactions for the pools, only a couple of holders right now, but will most likely change with MakerDAO having integrated it\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe payload to list the two G-UNI Pools as collateral types on the AMM market and to configure their price oracles is deployed at this contract address: [0x67e4EDE946b3d76c4C505566eB821a1470507d2d](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x67e4ede946b3d76c4c505566eb821a1470507d2d#code)\n\nTo execute the action governance simply calls `execute()` method (with no arguments) on the above contract address.\n\nOn execution both pools will be listed with the parameters in \"Simple Summary\" and with borrowing of G-UNI disabled.\n\n## References\n\n* [source code](https:\/\/github.com\/gelatodigital\/g-uni-v1-core)\n* [G-UNI docs](https:\/\/docs-g-uni.gelato.network\/)\n* [about gelato](https:\/\/gelato.network)\n* [gelato whitepaper](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1M6i1sa-dRhodw08MCLseytHTdkeFweBH)\n* Ethereum addresses contracts\n  - [G-UNI DAI \/ USDC](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x50379f632ca68d36e50cfbc8f78fe16bd1499d1e)\n  - [G-UNI USDC \/ USDT](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xd2eec91055f07fe24c9ccb25828ecfefd4be0c41)\n* ChainLink Oracle\n  - [DAI](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xaed0c38402a5d19df6e4c03f4e2dced6e29c1ee9)\n  - [USDC](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x8fffffd4afb6115b954bd326cbe7b4ba576818f6)\n  - [USDT](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x3e7d1eab13ad0104d2750b8863b489d65364e32d)\n* G-UNI Oracles\n  - [G-UNI DAI\/USDC Oracle](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x7843ea2e3e60b24cc12b56c5627adc7f9f0749d6#code)\n  - [G-UNI USDC\/USDT Oracle](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x399e3bb2bbd49c570aa6edc6ac390e0d0acbbd5e#code)\n* [audits](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1AGg9HvaRM8SKlONRCv2rehlNkn5UwqJZ?usp=sharing)\n* Communities\n  - [Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/ApbA39BKyJ)\n  - [Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/therealgelatonetwork)\n  - [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/gelatonetwork)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).\n\n","protocol":"aave","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x88215a2794ddC031439C72922EC8983bDE831c78","totalVotes":15,"blockNumber":13753639,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13753639}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13772839}","startTimestamp":1638812427,"endTimestamp":1639077739,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['NAY', 'YAE']","results":"[{'total': 624726.2, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13779962}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1639173313}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13773475}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1639086072}]"}
{"refId":"cHJvcG9zYWw6YWF2ZTpkZWZhdWx0OjUw","id":"50","title":"Q2 Dynamic Risk Parameters","content":"## Simple Summary \nA proposal to renew Gauntlet's [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters\/4854) engagement for continuous market risk management to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses.\n\n## Background\nSince mid-August, Gauntlet has provided [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters\/4854) and delivered on all areas outlined in the original proposal. Gauntlet has published 7 ARCs, Snapshots, and AIPs on parameter recommendations (102 parameter updates across 21 assets), 2 [Market](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review\/5572) [Risk](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/market-risk-monthly-updates-and-review-october-2021\/5887) Monthly reviews, new weekly risk updates in [Aave News](https:\/\/aavenews.substack.com\/p\/aave-news-risk-section-new-grantees), and launched the Aave [Risk Dashboard](https:\/\/gov.gauntlet.network\/aave). Gauntlet has invested heavily in the proper infrastructure including ETL data pipelines, agent-based simulation infrastructure, and financial models that make possible the parameter recommendations and front-end [Risk Dashboard](https:\/\/gov.gauntlet.network\/aave).\n\nThe below will outline how Gauntlet has been able to create value for the Aave ecosystem. We also describe specific ways the Gauntlet Platform will make an even more significant impact moving forward.\n\n## Impact of the Gauntlet Platform\n\nHow the Gauntlet Platform drives value to Lenders, Borrowers, and Aave stakeholders:   \n\n* Mitigating losses from liquidations and insolvencies - $6.7M of annual value\n* Increase capital efficiency and yield for users - $16.4M of annual value\n* Safely position Aave for sustainable growth \n\n\n### Mitigating losses from liquidations and insolvencies - $6.7M of annual value\n\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations save Borrowers' collateral lost to liquidators by safely lowering liquidation bonuses. When Borrowers' collateral are liquidated, they lose an extra portion of their collateral to liquidators. This bonus incentivizes liquidators but often can be reduced without sacrificing protocol risk.\n\nFrom our first liquidation bonus updates (2021-08-27) to present Gauntlet has saved Aave V2 protocol users $218,141 in liquidations due to lower liquidation bonuses, which equates to **$1,447,663** on an annualized basis. It is important to note that this time frame experienced relatively low levels of asset volatility. Higher levels of asset volatility would lead to more liquidations, and more savings realized. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, Gauntlet has reduced the total capital at risk due to insolvencies and liquidations when markets are under duress (Value at Risk). Gauntlet's parameter recommendations reduce VaR, following the community's [risk tolerance](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aave.eth\/proposal\/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi), which protects Borrowers, as less capital is expected to be lost during market shocks. In addition, lower VaR accrues value to Aave token holders, as insolvencies lead to payouts from Aave's Safety Module.\n\nOn average, Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations have shown a **14% reduction in VaR**. Our simulations observe an average of 0.48% of Aave V2's TVL being at risk on any given day. In the scenario where volatility reaches similar levels as Black Thursday, we expect to save Aave users an average of **$5,258,511** in liquidations and insolvencies.\n\nIn the future, should the community assign a `riskAdmin` role, Gauntlet can achieve more precise adjustments and streamlined risk management. Compared to the time-intensive ARC, Snapshot, and AIP processes, our response time during catastrophic market shocks would return tangible benefits. One example of this is adjusting liquidation bonuses swiftly to prevent liquidation cascades.\n\n### Increasing capital efficiency and yield for users - $16.4M of annual value\n \n \nOne of the core functions of the Gauntlet Platform is increasing capital efficiency for borrowers while controlling insolvency risk. Gauntlet's recommendations have led to higher borrow demand following lower collateralization ratios. On Sept. 4th, 6.1% of users had collateralization ratios below `2.00`. As of Oct. 21st, the number of accounts has grown by roughly 14%, and 8.9% of new accounts have collateralization ratios below `2.00`. **New positions opened after Gauntlet's parameter recommendations have higher borrow demand**, as seen in the histogram below.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rSbMyaa.png)\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Histogram of new accounts since 09\/04 by Collateralization Ratio and Borrow Value<\/p>\n\n\nFrom another angle, [Borrow Usage](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters\/4854#:~:text=the%20Gauntlet%20Recommendations.-,Borrow%20Usage,-provides%20information%20about) is an additional measure of capital efficiency and signifies how aggressively depositors of collateral borrow against their supply. Since Gauntlet's parameter recommendations, we have seen a **1.1 percentage points increase in borrow usage.** \n\nAlso, corresponding to these updates, an increase in yield for depositors has been realized. Depositor income the month before our parameter updates was $24.7M. The average monthly yield after Gauntlet's parameter updates was $37.7M. Increased capital efficiency and the resulting benefit to depositors should, at least in part, be attributed to risk parameter optimizations. Given the increase in borrow usage for the same amount of assets lent, Depositors will earn an estimated **$5.6M additional yield**.\n\nLet's look at an illustrative example of how a fast path, via `riskAdmin`, to parameter changes can facilitate opportunistically increasing LTVs and magnify impact. Say borrowers on AAVE have at least a 2% return on their borrowed capital above borrow cost. If we assume 50% of the year is low volatility, Gauntlet raises LTVs by an average of 5% during low volatility periods, and ~$20B of collateral on Aave, then we can conservatively estimate **$10M of value to Borrowers.** Those new borrows would also generate over $800K worth of additional interest income for depositors. \n\n\n\n### Safely position Aave for sustainable growth\n\nGauntlet's risk management empowers Aave not only to optimize existing assets but immediately support new assets. We have already made parameter updates for the newly added DPI in [AIP-43](https:\/\/app.aave.com\/#\/governance\/43-QmZb3yBeYJv1ruGWfY1h7XNcya82Q6Jqs4Q7b5dDMwuN3U). \n\nGauntlet is also closely monitoring the growth and stability of new assets FEI and FRAX. Should market conditions allow for safely turning on collateral, which initial simulations suggest can be done, we will seek community consensus to do so. Doing so could unlock $80M in collateral today and scaling proportionally, using the DAI borrowed on Aave to that in circulation, tens of millions more. \n\nSafely supporting new collateral helps make the DAO sustainable beyond the Ecosystem Reserve.\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nGauntlet has launched a [Risk Dashboard](https:\/\/gov.gauntlet.network\/aave) for the community to provide key insights into risk and capital efficiency. The dashboard focuses on both the system-level risk in Aave V2 and the market risk on an individual collateral level. Our goal is to help convey our methodology to the community and provide visibility into specific parameter recommendations. The dashboard will continue to be updated daily.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/X9Z8t49.png)\n\n\n## Expectations\n\n\nGauntlet will continue to deliver on the same risk parameters and communications plan outlined in the original [Proposal](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters\/4854\/5#:~:text=%24100k-,Expectations,-Risk%20Parameter%20Updates) while expanding the scope to include the two changes below:\n\n* Configuring Reserve Factors \n* Supporting Borrow Caps when the protocol is upgraded\n\n\n## Updated Cost\n\nGauntlet's standard liquidity protocol fee model has been updated  since the original proposal. The updated formula to calculate the service fee has four components:\n\n1. A proxy for capital efficiency\n2. Base fee of 10bps\n3. 30-Day TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price) of AAVE\n4. 25% discount for 1-year contract length\n\n\nComponent #1 is calculated as the 30-day average in Total Borrow. Component #4 signifies that a 25% discount is applied when the contract is 1-year (versus 1-quarter). \n\nSimply, pricing for a 1-year contract is calculated as:\n\n***Total Borrow * 10bps * (100%-25%) \/ AAVE Token Price***\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn just a few months, the Gauntlet Platform delivered significant value to the Aave ecosystem, and importantly, the future impact will be even greater. Through rigorous quantitative analysis and agent-based simulation frameworks derived from industries including algorithmic trading and autonomous vehicles, the Gauntlet Platform empowers Aave to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses. Gauntlet currently provides parameter recommendations covering over $49B of assets. Managing risk for numerous protocols allows our data scientists and engineers to improve our models ahead of realization events occurring on Aave. As Aave continues to scale, it is crucial to adapt and translate complexity into trade-offs to support community decisions. \n\n\n## Implementation \n\n* Aave v2 30-day average Total Borrow: $6.74B\n* 30-Day AAVE TWAP: $308.23\n\n\nThe annual service fee formula using the inputs above equals 16,412 AAVE.\n\n  \nThis AIP implements one streaming payment to Gauntlet denominated in stkAAVE. The stkAAVE is obtained by staking AAVE from the EcosystemReserve. The payment makes use of [Sablier](https:\/\/docs.sablier.finance\/) to implement a streaming vesting payment over the course of one calendar year. This payment can be revoked by governance using `cancelStream`. Specifically we make use of the following transactions:\n  - `transfer` `AAVE` tokens from the EcosystemReserve to the ShortExecutor using the Ecosystem Reserve Controller contract at 0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93\n  - `approve` the `stkAAVE` token to stake the `AAVE` we transferred\n  - `stake` the `AAVE` into `stkAAVE`\n  - `approve` the `Sablier` contracts to spend the remaining vesting portion of the `stkAAVE`\n  - `createStream` on the `Sablier` contract, with the Gauntlet set as the beneficiary, to stream the `stkAAVE`\n\n\nExact calldata and target addresses can be viewed in the transaction which created this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).","protocol":"aave","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x683a4F9915D6216f73d6Df50151725036bD26C02","totalVotes":18,"blockNumber":13716108,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13716108}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13735308}","startTimestamp":1638293499,"endTimestamp":1638558649,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['NAY', 'YAE']","results":"[{'total': 468453.16, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13747445}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1638726838}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13735632}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1638562731}]"}

This will allow a more rapid response in the event of an exploit or emergency. As you know, the Guardians were a community-elected set of DeFi participants, builders, and capital allocators (see here for more info).

We have performed a detailed analysis and documented it [here](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/add-fireblocks-as-a-whitelister-on-aave-arc\/5753) for the consideration of the Aave Governance community.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDeFi is considered by institutional users to be one of the more complex markets to navigate across security, compliance, and risk perspectives. We are eager to be at the forefront of this transformational opportunity with Aave Arc by extending access to even our most compliance-conscious customers, who have been searching to engage with DeFi in a way that comports with their own internal requirements.\n\nApproval of Fireblocks LLC can potentially also facilitate the integration of other \u201cwhitelisters\u201d and institutions into instances of the Aave protocol. This may have multiple benefits, including the creation of sustainable governance practices for Aave Arc whitelisters and whitelister customers, as well as the enablement of benefits to the ecosystem, such as the onboarding of regulated fiat on\/off ramps and protocol deployments connected to debit cards, high yield savings accounts and other innovative fintech products.\n\n## Specification\n\n\u201cWhitelisting\u201d is the gatekeeping function performed by whitelisters on users of Aave Arc. The term refers specifically to the process of:\n1. Conducting KYC\/KYB checks on the user;\n2. Onboarding the user with appropriate disclosures, terms, and conditions;\n3. Granting specific permissions (e.g., borrow, supply, liquidate) to the Ethereum wallet address(es) provided by the user.\n\nIn addition, Aave Arc whitelisters perform a similar role on Arc as guardians do on Aave V2. Specifically, whitelisters can use a multi-sig veto on governance proposals that add excessive compliance risk on the Aave Arc protocol. For example, existing whitelisters can veto the addition of a privacy coin if such a coin is impermissible in the relevant jurisdiction, or veto the addition of a whitelister that has a poor reputation for compliance.\n\nThe whitelisting is managed via a [PermissionManager](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract, in which whitelisters are designated as Permission Admins.  Permission Admins are permitted to add or remove wallets grants to the Aave Arc market by calling `addPermissions()` and `removePermissions()` contract methods, respectively. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThe Aave community voted on the [Snapshot proposal](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aave.eth\/proposal\/QmYQEh4vstJADjSK2b8nyK1otFG6R4rh9VHszU5xUEw26S) with Yes 149.2k AAVE (98.33%) and No 2.54k AAVE (1.67%).\n\n## Test Cases\n\nTest cases for an implementation are mandatory for AIPs but can be included with the implementation.\n\n## Implementation\n### Proposal\n\nExecutes the proposal deployed at:\n\n[https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xA7fC6E204c2069edb0ed5Fed451F419B985eC416#code](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xA7fC6E204c2069edb0ed5Fed451F419B985eC416#code)\n\nThe proposal executes the following:\n- Adds [Fireblocks](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x686a12A79008246F4dF2f1Ea30d136BD6DE748B4) as Permission Admin by calling addPermissionAdmins` on the [PermissionManager](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE) contract.\n\n`IPermissionManager(0xF4a1F5fEA79C3609514A417425971FadC10eCfBE).addPermissionAdmins([0x686a12A79008246F4dF2f1Ea30d136BD6DE748B4]);`\n\n- Unpause the pool by calling setPoolPause on the [LendingPoolConfigurator](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x4e1c7865e7BE78A7748724Fa0409e88dc14E67aA) contract.\n\n`ILendingPoolConfigurator(0x4e1c7865e7BE78A7748724Fa0409e88dc14E67aA).setPoolPause(false);`\n\n- Transfers the EmergencyAdmin role of the system to the [ArcTimelock's Veto DAO](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x33B09130b035d6D7e57d76fEa0873d9545FA7557).\n\n`provider.setEmergencyAdmin(ARC_TIMELOCK_VETO_DAO_ADDRESS);`\n\n- Transfers ownership of the system to the [ARC Market Multisig](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x23c155C1c1ecB18a86921Da29802292f1d282c68) temporarily until handed over to Aave Governance.\n\n`provider.transferOwnership(ARC_MARKET_MULTISIG_ADDRESS);`\n\n### Aave Arc Timelock\n\nAave Arc Timelock gives a guardian address the opportunity to cancel an approved governance action prior to its execution.\nThe timelock implementation can be found [here](https:\/\/github.com\/aave\/arc-timelock).\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).\n","protocol":"aave","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xB5Fe4248570954BCa6a2fCA5448f412AF5e4A424","totalVotes":18,"blockNumber":13638500,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13638500}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13657700}","startTimestamp":1637227539,"endTimestamp":1637491513,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['NAY', 'YAE']","results":"[{'total': 703627.7, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13663467}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1637570393}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13672718}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1637696239}]"}

AIP-32 incentives are due to expire 22nd November 2021.\n\nThis AIP presents the community with the opportunity to continue offering stkAAVE incentives for an additional 90 days from when AIP-32 finishes, up to including the 20th February 2021. The incentives will be distributed at a 30% reduced rate, commencing the tapering of incentives on the Aave V2 market.\n\nStable coin \/ low vol assets receive lending and borrowing incentives, split 1:2, in favour of borrowers over lenders. Aave V2\u2019s revenue is derived from interest paid by borrowers and borrowing demand drives lending yield through higher liquidity utilisation. High vol assets receive lending incentives, skewed towards assets more recently listed and communities that have static relationships with Aave, like Balancer and Chainlink.\n\n## Abstract\nThe intent is to recognise liquidity mining incentives played a large role in helping grow Aave V2 TVL, whilst being conscious that competitors continue to offer incentives APRs marginally exceeding what Aave is currently offering.\n\nWhen incentives were reduced aggressively on the Polygon market, the daily revenue reduced significantly. There is a risk that by tapering liquidity mining incentives on Aave V2 too aggressively could trigger the same outcome as what was experienced on the Polygon market.\n- [AIP-16](https:\/\/app.aave.com\/#\/governance\/11-Qmf1JeXiw8BDUoKJ89VmUJ8wy22D2udqL4HxprCG7DZ5zG): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 26th April 2021\n- [AIP-32](https:\/\/app.aave.com\/#\/governance\/28-QmWaac9UwQuiBtsGpm4oG6TwnVd86DWfqtVV8f11y5ZM5E): 2,200 stkAAVE per day from 24th August 2021\n- AIP-47: 1,540 stkAAVE per day from 22nd November 2021\n\nBased on the learnings from the Polygon market and reviewing the governance forum, this proposal reduces Liquidity Mining rewards by 30% over the next 90 days. For the following 90 days during 2022, the logic would be to continue further reducing incentives pending how the market reacts to the implementation of this proposal.\n\nIt is to the benefit of the protocol to incentivise borrows more than depositors. Conceptually, incentivizing borrows already increases deposit rates, so passive depositors still benefit significantly.\n\nTo encourage the depositing of high volatility assets, this proposal suggests incentivising the lending of newly listed assets and continuing to offer incentives on those that are strategically important for the Aave community. Offering incentives on newly listed assets is expected to kickstart the supply of liquidity.\n\n## Motivation\nAs a community member, liquidity mining has been great for bringing more users as stakeholders for the Aave Protocol and distributing the governance power to a wider more decentralised group of holders. Distributing stkAAVE means users also backstoppers of the protocol and automatically have skin in the game.\n\nI would say that most liquidity that a liquidity protocol such as the Aave Protocol needs is stablecoins - incentivised as diversely as possible and also encouraging stablecoins that are aiming towards decentralization such as RAI and FRAX.\n\nI would like to present to the community an opportunity to continue distributing stkAAVE at the same rate per day across the Aave V2 market with the intention of achieving the following:\n1. Grow Total Value Locked (TVL)\n2. Increase liquidity\n3. Attractive (low) borrow rates\n4. Increase the protocol income via growing the Reserve Factor\n5. Redistribute governance power towards users of the platform\n\nAs the value deposited within the Aave V2 market has grown from ~$5B to ~$21B and the $AAVE price has underperformed this growth, the incentive APR is lower now relative to the start of the prior incentive period.\n\nOn the 17th June 2021, the incentives on Polygon were reduced by 5x and revenue fell from $55.77K per day to $32.27K per day. This highlights the risk of reducing incentives to hastily. It is worth noting Compound is providing liquidity mining rewards similar to the existing 2,200 stkAAVE distribution level in terms of APR across key stable coin (low vol asset) markets.\n\n![](https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/lE7K7WfialLF8azUDUcpPCwAebWhqHnqi9x5ljWosp5mofq8IRSptYqPv2dXuV4m_IR3uVg3HqCXfTNNY5rzBBp9U5LDztOe9a3dv-ZjwZuFNs83H5ATP37G5tuCJqUrrjdC9uvh=s1600)\nRef.

The overall number of stkAAVE distributor per day is the same and with a larger capital base, generating to a lower APR. The allocations are based loosely around the dollar value of deposits (lenders) and position users to borrow stables. The intent is to drive borrowing demand which will then lead to a higher lending APR. This is further encouraged by incentivising depositing of higher vol assets as collateral which will grow the TVL.\n\nFinal Proposal  \n![](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/aave\/optimized\/2X\/6\/669bbad486a552cb972b0fef3388489c107205bc_2_757x750.png)  \nNote: TVL per token is as per the 21st October 2021.\n\nMath: % of value deposited x multiplier then scaled to provide LM Allocation that totals 100%. [Link here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1trx6tYr1jy5Izs-IfPTrGCp1y6EExCgyu4P8pme_Y_8\/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAll gas costs incurred implementing this AIP is to be reimbursed by Aave in the form of $AAVE. These costs work out to approximately 70 $AAVE.\n\n## Rational\nBelow is a list of the key considerations made when designing the third iteration of Liquidity Mining for the Aave V2 market:\n- Compound continues to offer liquidity mining incentives that marginally exceed those on Aave V2 marketplace. Thus, the risk is that if incentives are reduced aggressively capital migrates to another platform offering more compelling incentives.\n- When the Polygon market aggressively reduced incentives, TVL and therefore revenue dropped significantly. There is a risk that similar behaviour could be experienced on mainnet.\n- Borrowing is the key activity on Aave. Only borrowers pay a fee to use Aave\u2019s liquidity and Aave\u2019s portion of this fee accumulates in the Reserve Factor. Thus, borrowers technically provide more value to the protocol by:\n    - Increasing depositor interest\n    - Increasing reserve factor earnings\n    - Incentivizing borrows more than deposits reduces the maximum earnings from a \u201cleverage loop\u201d\n- Aave V2 TVL is heavily composed of three main stable coins (low vol assets) USDC, DAI and USDT. In effort to support the largest revenue generating pools, incentives are skewed towards low vol assets.\n- In an attempt to grow TVL and capture the less centralised low vol asset markets, incentives for lending and borrowing assets like RAI have been introduced and are treated in a similar fashion to existing more centralised low vol assets like USDC.\n\nCapital Efficiency and Risk Considerations\n- We did consider introducing a high health factor >2 which reduces the appeal of gamification and recursive lending. However, the implementation was [ruled out](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/arc-extend-aave-liquidity-mining-rewards\/4852\/46) as too much work and increased centralisation of the incentive scheme.\n- Recursive behavior does not significantly increase risk as it is typically looped within a single asset. The Aave V2 market is designed to accommodate high levels of borrowing and the risk parameters set in place ensure the protocol is in a healthy state. The risk within the protocol is not connected to liquidity mining, but to the overall proper risk parameter management.\n\nEconomics\n- Aave V2 markets daily Reserve Revenue is averaging around $170K per day. Daily aToken interest is around $3K per day.\n- Liquidity Mining is estimated to cost $492,800 per day assuming 1,540 stkAAVE at $320 per token. Down from $704,000 per day assuming 2,200 stkAAVE at $320 per token.\n- Ecosystem Reserve is worth around $700M with an AAVE price of $320.\n- 90 days at 1,540 stkAAVE at $320 per token is $44,352,000 or around 6.33% of the Ecosystem Reserve.\n- The Net spend is $29,052,000 per day after taking into consideration the daily Reserve Revenue and daily liquidity mining expenses. This does not take into consideration the 550 AAVE\/day Safety Module incentives\n- Daily Reserve Revenue is continually growing over time, any Reserve Revenue moving average trends higher from the middle of May onwards when the price of ETH dropped 60%.\n\n![](https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/1m4kq_urmX9q5f2ejJmoxlDUzFoi-vGWKJESgXR6oJ2XyTltDG5jHrOtdTr446PQDHUWMNyqy--zXqj1A9Yx82P4NTCpqh-fZORoRhiPoA7NTezP5kUKWD-UnuJj3mZSDs-m51TC=s1600)\n\nFurther details on the daily Reserve Revenue and Economic Reserve valuation can be found on the [Aave Treasury Dashboard](https:\/\/dune.xyz\/llama\/Aave-Treasury-Finances-by-Llama?Trailing%20Num%20Time-Series=180) created by the Llama Community.\n\n## Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CCO](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/)","protocol":"aave","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x7f4C5938AF9731e9feadc09C3FA782508198532E","totalVotes":14,"blockNumber":13638437,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13638437}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13657637}","startTimestamp":1637226576,"endTimestamp":1637490811,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['NAY', 'YAE']","results":"[{'total': 599441.8, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13657643}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1637490899}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13664001}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1637577539}]"}

We also describe specific ways the Gauntlet Platform will make an even more significant impact moving forward.\n\n## Impact of the Gauntlet Platform\n\nHow the Gauntlet Platform drives value to Lenders, Borrowers, and Aave stakeholders:   \n\n* Mitigating losses from liquidations and insolvencies - $6.7M of annual value\n* Increase capital efficiency and yield for users - $16.4M of annual value\n* Safely position Aave for sustainable growth \n\n\n### Mitigating losses from liquidations and insolvencies - $6.7M of annual value\n\n\nGauntlet's parameter recommendations save Borrowers' collateral lost to liquidators by safely lowering liquidation bonuses. When Borrowers' collateral are liquidated, they lose an extra portion of their collateral to liquidators. This bonus incentivizes liquidators but often can be reduced without sacrificing protocol risk.\n\nFrom our first liquidation bonus updates (2021-08-27) to present Gauntlet has saved Aave V2 protocol users $218,141 in liquidations due to lower liquidation bonuses, which equates to **$1,447,663** on an annualized basis. It is important to note that this time frame experienced relatively low levels of asset volatility. Higher levels of asset volatility would lead to more liquidations, and more savings realized. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, Gauntlet has reduced the total capital at risk due to insolvencies and liquidations when markets are under duress (Value at Risk). Gauntlet's parameter recommendations reduce VaR, following the community's [risk tolerance](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aave.eth\/proposal\/QmT9T4Rfnh1Z2HYmMPXvtFotMK2vSxiXK8dKStg2b6n4gi), which protects Borrowers, as less capital is expected to be lost during market shocks. In addition, lower VaR accrues value to Aave token holders, as insolvencies lead to payouts from Aave's Safety Module.\n\nOn average, Gauntlet\u2019s recommendations have shown a **14% reduction in VaR**. Our simulations observe an average of 0.48% of Aave V2's TVL being at risk on any given day. In the scenario where volatility reaches similar levels as Black Thursday, we expect to save Aave users an average of **$5,258,511** in liquidations and insolvencies.\n\nIn the future, should the community assign a `riskAdmin` role, Gauntlet can achieve more precise adjustments and streamlined risk management. Compared to the time-intensive ARC, Snapshot, and AIP processes, our response time during catastrophic market shocks would return tangible benefits. One example of this is adjusting liquidation bonuses swiftly to prevent liquidation cascades.\n\n### Increasing capital efficiency and yield for users - $16.4M of annual value\n \n \nOne of the core functions of the Gauntlet Platform is increasing capital efficiency for borrowers while controlling insolvency risk. Gauntlet's recommendations have led to higher borrow demand following lower collateralization ratios. On Sept. 4th, 6.1% of users had collateralization ratios below `2.00`. As of Oct. 21st, the number of accounts has grown by roughly 14%, and 8.9% of new accounts have collateralization ratios below `2.00`. **New positions opened after Gauntlet's parameter recommendations have higher borrow demand**, as seen in the histogram below.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rSbMyaa.png)\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">Histogram of new accounts since 09\/04 by Collateralization Ratio and Borrow Value<\/p>\n\n\nFrom another angle, [Borrow Usage](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters\/4854#:~:text=the%20Gauntlet%20Recommendations.-,Borrow%20Usage,-provides%20information%20about) is an additional measure of capital efficiency and signifies how aggressively depositors of collateral borrow against their supply. Since Gauntlet's parameter recommendations, we have seen a **1.1 percentage points increase in borrow usage.** \n\nAlso, corresponding to these updates, an increase in yield for depositors has been realized. Depositor income the month before our parameter updates was $24.7M. The average monthly yield after Gauntlet's parameter updates was $37.7M. Increased capital efficiency and the resulting benefit to depositors should, at least in part, be attributed to risk parameter optimizations. Given the increase in borrow usage for the same amount of assets lent, Depositors will earn an estimated **$5.6M additional yield**.\n\nLet's look at an illustrative example of how a fast path, via `riskAdmin`, to parameter changes can facilitate opportunistically increasing LTVs and magnify impact. Say borrowers on AAVE have at least a 2% return on their borrowed capital above borrow cost. If we assume 50% of the year is low volatility, Gauntlet raises LTVs by an average of 5% during low volatility periods, and ~$20B of collateral on Aave, then we can conservatively estimate **$10M of value to Borrowers.** Those new borrows would also generate over $800K worth of additional interest income for depositors. \n\n\n\n### Safely position Aave for sustainable growth\n\nGauntlet's risk management empowers Aave not only to optimize existing assets but immediately support new assets. We have already made parameter updates for the newly added DPI in [AIP-43](https:\/\/app.aave.com\/#\/governance\/43-QmZb3yBeYJv1ruGWfY1h7XNcya82Q6Jqs4Q7b5dDMwuN3U). \n\nGauntlet is also closely monitoring the growth and stability of new assets FEI and FRAX. Should market conditions allow for safely turning on collateral, which initial simulations suggest can be done, we will seek community consensus to do so. Doing so could unlock $80M in collateral today and scaling proportionally, using the DAI borrowed on Aave to that in circulation, tens of millions more. \n\nSafely supporting new collateral helps make the DAO sustainable beyond the Ecosystem Reserve.\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nGauntlet has launched a [Risk Dashboard](https:\/\/gov.gauntlet.network\/aave) for the community to provide key insights into risk and capital efficiency. The dashboard focuses on both the system-level risk in Aave V2 and the market risk on an individual collateral level. Our goal is to help convey our methodology to the community and provide visibility into specific parameter recommendations. The dashboard will continue to be updated daily.\n\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/X9Z8t49.png)\n\n\n## Expectations\n\n\nGauntlet will continue to deliver on the same risk parameters and communications plan outlined in the original [Proposal](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/proposal-dynamic-risk-parameters\/4854\/5#:~:text=%24100k-,Expectations,-Risk%20Parameter%20Updates) while expanding the scope to include the two changes below:\n\n* Configuring Reserve Factors \n* Supporting Borrow Caps when the protocol is upgraded\n\n\n## Updated Cost\n\nGauntlet's standard liquidity protocol fee model has been updated universally since the original proposal. The updated formula to calculate the service fee still has four components:\n1. An asset multiplier to track risk management complexity \n2. **[Updated] A proxy for capital efficiency**\n3. **[Updated] A marginal base fee**\n4. **[Updated] 30-Day VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) of AAVE**\n\n\nComponent #1 remains the same. The asset multiplier calculation is log(Number of Assets, 10)*. New assets on the protocol add complexity to risk management. \n\nComponents #2, #3, and #4 have been updated. Total Borrow remains the best proxy for capital efficiency and is now calculated as the 30-day average and rounded down to the nearest $1B. The base fee now takes marginal reductions to be more scalable for DAOs. Lastly, the requested AAVE denomination has been updated to protect the DAO and Gauntlet from short-term price fluctuations.\n\n\n| Marginal Base Fee | Total Borrow |\n| ----------------- | ------------ |\n| 10 bps            | $0 - $5B     |\n|           5 bps   | $6B - $10B   |\n|         2.5 bps   | $11B - $15B  |\n| 1.25 bps          | $16B - $20B  |\n\n\n\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BWG7RI4.png)\n\n<sup>*Gauntlet quarterly service fee denominated in AAVE (table above calculated at $345)<\/sup>\n\n---\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn just a few months, the Gauntlet Platform delivered significant value to the Aave ecosystem, and importantly, the future impact will be even greater. Through rigorous quantitative analysis and agent-based simulation frameworks derived from industries including algorithmic trading and autonomous vehicles, the Gauntlet Platform empowers Aave to optimize yield, capital efficiency, and mitigate depositor losses. Gauntlet currently provides parameter recommendations covering over $49B of assets. Managing risk for numerous protocols allows our data scientists and engineers to improve our models ahead of realization events occurring on Aave. As Aave continues to scale, it is crucial to adapt and translate complexity into trade-offs to support community decisions. \n\n\n## Implementation \n\n* Aave v2 30-day average Total Borrow: \\$6.74B\n* 30-Day AAVE VWAP: \\$345.231184773\n* Current Number of Aave v2 Assets = 31\n\nThe quarterly service fee formula using the inputs above equals 5940 AAVE.\n\n  \nThis AIP implements one streaming payment to Gauntlet denominated in stkAAVE. The stkAAVE is obtained by staking AAVE from the EcosystemReserve. The payment makes use of [Sablier](https:\/\/docs.sablier.finance\/) to implement a streaming vesting payment over the course of one calendar quarter. This payment can be revoked by governance using `cancelStream`. Specifically we make use of the following transactions:\n  - `transfer` `AAVE` tokens from the EcosystemReserve to the ShortExecutor using the Ecosystem Reserve Controller contract at 0x1E506cbb6721B83B1549fa1558332381Ffa61A93\n  - `approve` the `stkAAVE` token to stake the `AAVE` we transferred\n  - `stake` the `AAVE` into `stkAAVE`\n  - `approve` the `Sablier` contracts to spend the remaining vesting portion of the `stkAAVE`\n  - `createStream` on the `Sablier` contract, with the Gauntlet set as the beneficiary, to stream the `stkAAVE`\n\n\nExact calldata and target addresses can be viewed in the transaction which created this proposal.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).\n","protocol":"aave","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x683a4F9915D6216f73d6Df50151725036bD26C02","totalVotes":20,"blockNumber":13584286,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13584286}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13603486}","startTimestamp":1636489650,"endTimestamp":1636749479,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['NAY', 'YAE']","results":"[{'total': 309403.25, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 340578.84, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

We build decentralized social saving applications that combine game design elements with goal-based saving. We want to help our community to develop better financial habits, and have fun at the same time.\n\ntl;dr If you make all deposits, you earn a slice of the pool\u2019s interest, and additional rewards! More details can be found in the DAO thread.\n\nPotential collaboration  \nWe want to expose the GoodGhosting community to Aavegotchi, by introducing an Aavegotchi-themed savings pool. This pool will require players to save in GHST tokens, and earn them more GHST on top. We see it as a fun opportunity to cross-pollinate the GoodGhosting and Aavegotchi communities.\n\nAavegotchi is a one-of-a-kind project we have been keeping a close eye on from the very start. Both as players and as ecosystem residents. In our opinion, it envisions everything that DeFi and Web3 is about \ud83d\udc7b\n\nBesides inviting all Aavegotchi users and the DAO itself to participate in the upcoming GHST savings pool, GoodGhosting would like to request the AavegotchiDAO to consider co-sponsoring this pool.\n\nOur Request  \nA total of 7000 GHST in sponsorship for this savings pool. To be shared between all winning players.\nThe ability to reward successful savers with Gotchi XP, or alternatively FRENS. Considering GoodGhosting an extensive mini-game that encourages people to stack more GHST.\nAn allocation of Aavegotchi NFTs (worth up to 3000 GHST) to be raffled to random participants and\/or to all winners. These could be Wearables, Gotchi\u2019s, Raffle tickets or Realm parcels. \n These could either be provided by the AavegotchiDAO, or alternatively purchased by the GoodGhosting team on the Bazaar. For these additional incentives, we hope to provide benefits to a small handful of lucky winners (via a raffle system), and\/or a smaller reward that is feasible to be delivered to all winners. \n\nWhat can GoodGhosting bring to the table?  \nUp to 4000 WMATIC tokens in sponsorship (from our DeFiForAll grant). To be shared between all winning players.\nAn influx of new users into the Aavegotchi ecosystem. So far over 20500 users joined our Celo and Polygon savings pools. Most have not yet been exposed to Aavegotchi or GHST, and many are likely to join the Gotchigang.\nWe will create a YouTube video explaining Aavegotchi, and how to obtain the GHST token on Polygon. Directed at our community members.\nWe will allow users to play GoodGhosting using their Aavegotchis as avatar.

It leaves investors wondering if they should hold onto their Gotchis and Wearables, or if they might find better ROI flipping into the next rounds. It would be desirable to have a bit of certainty \/ predictability for both investor sentiment and for planning purposes.\n\nSolution  \nIf possible funding-wise, Rarity Farming should happen three times a year. It would fit in with the seasonal nature we are already following, and if properly planned could be sustainable based on GBM Sales in-between seasons, Treasury revenue via staking and partnerships (such as the Umbra Bridge proposal), and other streams of revenue such as DAO Grants. The author of this proposal believes Rarity Farming is an essential part of the Gotchiverse ecosystem, and something to build out and improve upon rather than scrap.\n\nDistribution  \nFor Season 3, I suggest we go back to the standard reward ratio, as was tried and tested in Tarity Farming Season 1. The rookies of the similarly named rookie board are now all grown up and ready to compete with the big boys. This would mean 70% of payouts go to the BRS leaderboard, 20% to the Kinship leaderboard and 10% to the XP leaderboard.\n\nBased on Forum discussions this would be the final model for SZN3:\n4 Rounds (2 weeks each)\n1.5 Million GHST Rewards Pool (1.4m GHST funded already)\n70% BRS\n20% Kinship\n10% XP\nTop 5k Gotchis (20%) \u2192 Top 7.5k Gotchis (30%)\n3 Seasons per Year (approx. schedule below)\nSZN 3: February - March\nSZN 4: June - July\nSZN 5: October - November\n\nUpdated Rewards Sheet: Rarity Farming SZN 3 Distribution Model\n\nSince there is a ~100k GHST discrepancy between the proposed amount to be distributed and GHST currently in the rewards pool, this proposal includes a funding request for the remaining amount to be taken out of the AavegotchiDAO Treasury.

The current utilisation rate is at 45% with a deposit APR ~2.5%. Given the significant yield and quickly growing utility of the GHST token, we anticipate ongoing borrowing demand, and, thus, yield for GHST depositors and the DAO Treasury. The Aavegotchi DAO can demonstrate its dexterity, effectiveness, and impressive treasury by quickly capitalizing on this passive yield opportunity. This would speak volumes to the broader DeFI and crypto community and immediately provide additional value to GHST token holders through increased borrowing capacity in the Aave pool.\n\nAn initial deposit of 3,000,000 GHST would represent approximately 80% of the DAO Treasury GHST. This deposit is completely liquid and could be withdrawn if the DAO designates other uses. A 3% APR is nearly $90,000 which can be used to further invest in the Aavegotchi ecosystem through DAO initiatives. A separate proposal can be considered for the additional 20% and for the 2.4M DAI in the treasury. We do not propose that the received amGHST from this proposed initial deposit be staked for frens. This proposal is not requesting DTF multi-sig control over this deposit or the ongoing management. If the signal proposal passes, an abstain option will be included in the core proposition. \n-Dr Wagmi\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n","protocol":"aavegotchi","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xF815a566E42b0D8ddD5D77f91409A7d9CeB10B92","totalVotes":15,"blockNumber":24594824,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aavegotchi.eth\/proposal\/0x52504f9d7b83ee4e9e076fd9e33df76ee2d9dfd0128d57fd2e60c0da41f9cb5b","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644100200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644706800}","startTimestamp":1644100200,"endTimestamp":1644706800,"currentState":"active","choices":"['Yes.

This committee will initially be composed of 8 members with reassessment of membership by the DAO within 6 months.\n\nAs of 12\/07\/2021, the DAO Treasury (https:\/\/aavegotchi.com\/treasury) boasts nearly ~$11,408,400 worth of DAI and GHST. In its initial form, the committee will form proposals for consideration by the DAO which will subsequently be voted on and, if passed, enacted.\n\n**Proposed Mission Statement**\nThe Aavegotchi DAO Treasury Taask Force is a dynamic committee assigned with making DAO treasury management proposals to the community and DAO for consideration. The initial mission and goals of the committee will be: 1) Grow and optimize the DAO treasury with an emphasis on safety, security and transparency; 2) Partner with Pixelcraft to assist in developing and identifying tools and infrastructure for ongoing DAO Treasury management; and 3) Foster and encourage growth of the overall Aavegotchi community by increasing awareness, actively promoting adoption, and maintaining current user engagement.\n\n**Initial Funding**\nAfter lengthy discussions with the task force, the community, and with coderdan, the DTF would like to request an initial 50,000 GHST budget. The 50,000 GHST budget would be transferred from the DAO Treasury to the 8 multi-signature Gnosis Safe. This budget will greatly expand the flexibility of the DAO in incentivizing and rewarding engaged community members, developers, creatives, and overall contributors. This budget will never be used to reward members of the DTF. The DTF\u2019s core main initiative will be to form a proposal for overall use of the DAO Treasury by investing some of the $10 million DAI\/GHST in yield bearing opportunities. With effective deployment of the DAO Treasury, even modest returns would more than pay for the DTF budget request. The DTF will ensure comprehensive accounting and provide community facing documentation to ensure transparency. Some potential uses for the budget include the following:\n\nReward community engagement and aarcade play\nReward game developers and designers\nReward community application developers\nReward and acknowledge community art contributions\nReward, acknowledge and grow content creators and general marketing efforts\nExpand Aavegotchi and GHST\u2019s opportunities for decentralized financial applications\n\nThe DTF is developing a structured plan and multiple potential pilot projects to best utilize these funds. We will work to develop tools to allow maximum transparency into the budget use. Expenses within this 50,000 GHST budget would not require a DAO approval in order to maximize nimble use of the funds. Any further budget requests beyond the initial 50,000 GHST would require a DAO vote.\n\n\n**The initial 8 members of the DTF**\nBowtiedNerd\nMori\nletsgobankless\nAddison\nDeucehearts\nBackfireCapital\nSwappi\nDr Wagmi\n\nWe appreciate the Aavegotchi community\u2019s support and look forward to our first proposal.\n\nOption 1: Yes, with 50k GHST budget\nOption 2: Yes, without 50k GHST budget\nOption 3: No, do not create the DTF\n","protocol":"aavegotchi","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x027Ffd3c119567e85998f4E6B9c3d83D5702660c","totalVotes":2784,"blockNumber":24455551,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aavegotchi.eth\/proposal\/0x17f3eec096b26e87b3441f7cad53108f6933fd32ac67417de6ef7c94970502e4","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643731200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644336000}","startTimestamp":1643731200,"endTimestamp":1644336000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, with 50k GHST budget', 'Yes, without 50k GHST budget', 'No, do not create the DTF']","results":"[{'total': 17287358, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 845839.06, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 395321.06, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

The team\u2019s background is a great combination of traditional finance and DeFi. SynFutures is the only project of its kind which can support the listing of any assets by anyone in a permissionless manner (in less than 30s).\n\n**Security**\nBacked by solid experience from the TradFi financial engineering and DeFi protocol safety, SynFutures has many risk management features (e.g. anti-flashloan attack, EMA smoothing method, etc.) and has gone through external code audits.\n\n**Easy to manage and start**\nSynFutures supports a single token model to add liquidity which means the Aavegotchi Treasury would only have to deposit GHST instead of offering two tokens with the risk of impermanent loss. We are asking for 200k worth of GHST tokens to kickstart the pool. The liquidity could be withdrawn anytime.\n\n**Growth Potential**\nTrading volume and users are growing fast on SynFutures. For the past 3 months since the SynFutures Alpha launched, we reached 47k users of and $1bn+ in trading volume.

In our opinion, it envisions everything that DeFi and Web3 is about\u00a0\ud83d\udc7b\n\n\nBesides inviting all Aavegotchi users and the DAO itself to participate in the upcoming GHST savings pool, GoodGhosting would like to request the AavegotchiDAO to **consider co-sponsoring this pool**.\n\n### Our Request\n\n- A total of **7000 GHST** in sponsorship for this savings pool.\n_To be shared between all winning players._\n\n- The ability to reward successful savers with **Gotchi XP**, _or alternatively FRENS_. _Considering GoodGhosting an extensive mini-game that encourages people to stack more GHST._\n\n- An allocation of **Aavegotchi NFTs (worth up to 3000 GHST)** to be raffled to random participants and\/or to all winners. These could be Wearables, Gotchi\u2019s, Raffle tickets or Realm parcels. _These could either be provided by the AavegotchiDAO, or alternatively purchased by the GoodGhosting team on the Bazaar. For these additional incentives, we hope to provide benefits to a small handful of lucky winners (via a raffle system), and\/or a smaller reward that is feasible to be delivered to all winners._\n\n\n### What can GoodGhosting bring to the table?\n- Up to **4000 WMATIC** tokens in sponsorship\u00a0(from our DeFiForAll grant). _To be shared between all winning players._\n\n- An **influx of new users** into the Aavegotchi ecosystem. _So far over 20500 users joined our Celo and Polygon savings pools. Most have not yet been exposed to Aavegotchi or GHST, and many are likely to join the Gotchigang._ \n\n- We will create a **YouTube video** explaining Aavegotchi, and how to obtain the GHST token on Polygon. Directed at our community members.\n- We will allow users to **play GoodGhosting using their Aavegotchi\u2019s as avatar**. _This will show up in the shared \u2018Players\u2019 tab, as well as in the individual player profiles on Goodghosting.com_\n- Some very **special NFTs** by our in-house artist [Mali3D](https:\/\/www.mali3.de\/)\n- An increased [GG score](https:\/\/medium.com\/goodghosting\/launching-the-gg-score-66acd783dd53) for all successful savers\n\n\n#### We look forward to proceeding in a way to benefit both Aavegotchi and GoodGhosting in some serious Ghostly synergy.\n\n### Do you support this proposal?\n","protocol":"aavegotchi","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xca4aD39F872E89Ef23eABd5716363Fc22513E147","totalVotes":970,"blockNumber":24390111,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aavegotchi.eth\/proposal\/0x6d6a96b75102b5808de9f4bdb6dc98062085847f3c4241ae5243af4f1608434f","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643652000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644062400}","startTimestamp":1643652000,"endTimestamp":1644062400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, up to 10k GHST rewards + XP', 'Yes, but under different terms', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 11614836, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 955354.3, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 126530.3, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

The Umbria Narni bridging cost is about 1\/2 of the official polygon bridge cost and is also much faster (4 minutes, as opposed to > 1 hour).\n\nThe Umbria Narni bridge protocol can bridge a maximum of 20% of its total GHST liquidity, per bridging event. For example, with $100k of GHST tokens in one side of the pool, the bridge can migrate a maximum of $20k of GHST per single transaction.  \n\nCurrently there is approximately $14,000 of GHST tokens on each side of the bridge. This is mostly funded by the Umbria team. This enables the bridge to be able to bridge a maximum of $700 of GHST tokens per transaction - which is pretty good, but we are aware that some users want to bridge much more in a single transaction.\n\nWe propose the Aavegotchi DAO add $100,000 of GHST to each bridge pool (1. Polygon and 2. Ethereum). There are a few advantages for doing so:\n\n1. The Aavegotchi DAO will earn a 0.2% bridging fee whenever anyone uses the bridge to migrate GHST tokens between Ethereum <--> Polygon. So across time, the Aavegotchi DAO will make money. If the Narni bridge ever becomes an unnecessary solution, the Aavegotchi DAO can easily remove their liquidity and enjoy their profit.\n\n2. Transactions up to approximately $21,000 of GHST will now be possible. \n\n3. Aavegotchi community will learn about our bridge which enables migration of assets for WAY cheaper than the official polygon bridge. A great quality of life improvement if they are participating in other projects too.\n\n- ETH average cost $4 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 1 hour\n- USDT average cost $9 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 1 hour\n- USDC average cost $9 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 1 hour\n- MATIC average cost $9 - time 4 minutes, compared to > 7 days\n\n4. Unlike the official Polygon bridge who offer absolutely no technical support, even in the event of a bridge error (You literally just lose your funds), the Umbria Narni bridge has a dedicated discord support team who have an excellent reputation for speedily resolving any issues and guarantee transaction resolution in the event of an unforeseen error. \n\n---\n\nThe Umbria Narni bridge is administered and coordinated by a publicly listed company Online Blockchain PLC from the UK, who are bound by the rules and regulations of the UK financial conduct authority. It has also been audited by ADVFN, and is in the process of several other audits. \n\nThe Umbria project is officially partnered with polygon, as well as a number of popular NFT projects including Zedrun, Aavegotchi, The Red Village and many others. \n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, I (Dev Oskii - @OskiiDev on twitter and \"! Dev Oskii | Umbria Network\" on Discord) would be more than happy to answer them in the official Umbria discord channel https:\/\/discord.gg\/Epse2vauA8\n\nI hope you approve this DAO proposal so our platform can improve the user experience for Aavegotchi.\n\nThanks for reading :)","protocol":"aavegotchi","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xEe0861faBEdc0BD4E41fe9fE97E6Cd1c7e4B717a","totalVotes":1391,"blockNumber":22475588,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aavegotchi.eth\/proposal\/0xe011f10e23135bf2cfe25f67ab143d2cdad03c0ffae9f9c520d75442b2622644","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639393200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642071600}","startTimestamp":1639393200,"endTimestamp":1642071600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Add $200k GHST Stake', \"Don't Add GHST Stake\"]","results":"[{'total': 9358120, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 806311, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

It leaves investors wondering if they should hold onto their gotchis and wearables, or if they might find better ROI flipping into the next rounds. It would be desirable to have a bit of certainty \/ predictability for both investor sentiment and for planning purposes. \n\nSolution: \nWhen possible funding-wise, rarity farms should be a quarterly event. It would fit in with the seasonal nature we are already following, and if properly planned could be sustainable based on GBM sales in-between seasons, treasury revenue via staking and partnerships (such as the umbra bridge proposal also live now), and other streams of revenue such as DAO grants. The author of this proposal believes rarity farming is an essential part of the gotchiverse ecosystem, and something to build out and improve upon rather than scrap.\n\nFor season 3, I suggest we go back to the standard reward ratio, as was tried and tested in rarity farming season 1. \nThe rookies of the similarly named rookie board are now all grown up and ready to compete with the big boys.  This would mean 70% of payouts go to the BRS leaderboard,  20% to the kinship leaderboard and 10% to the XP leaderboard. \n\nIdeally, we would kick the rarity farm off in mid-late January 2022; this would fit snugly into the timing of the gotchiverse release, and would position us right in the first quarter of a new fiscal year.","protocol":"aavegotchi","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xE29555e804e414E295E2A059Fc49d002EC18F268","totalVotes":1488,"blockNumber":22882931,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aavegotchi.eth\/proposal\/0x41faa0fa14ed1948a7e0c0c8e0f79890762181d7648c206117324143ffccec40","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640296800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1641463200}","startTimestamp":1640296800,"endTimestamp":1641463200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes, let's have season 3 in Q1\", \"No, don't have season 3\"]","results":"[{'total': 10267048, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1053062.6, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

That said, we have always envisioned an area or areas for Pixelcraft to develop in-depth experiences that add value to the overall game. Likewise, one of our earliest ideas, (predating the Citaadel itself!) was to reserve a town square for real time DAO voting. The idea of having a gamified governance experience was one of the very earliest ideas seeding Aavegotchi\u2019s need for its own virtual world. \n\nPerhaps this is why the thought of amending the Litepaper or publishing an official change regarding district allocations slipped through the cracks. We spoke about the Pixelcraft and DAO square areas as if they\u2019d always existed! The idea for districts partially arose out of these two \u201csquares\u201d along with a combination of our development tracks reinforcing one another: gameplay, map design, auction prep, and progress with the path to smart contract executed non-playable characters (NPCs).\n\nIt was no ill intent and definitely an oversight. That said, we recognize that it is indeed a big allocation and are fine with whichever way the DAO votes on keeping or removing the 1000 parcels for Pixelcraft Studios currently assigned to District 27.\n\nOption 1: Yes, implement Patch 0.1e\nOption 2: No, do not implement Patch 0.1e \n","protocol":"aavegotchi","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x027Ffd3c119567e85998f4E6B9c3d83D5702660c","totalVotes":2264,"blockNumber":22358304,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aavegotchi.eth\/proposal\/0x606addda8240b2209a1721a843e7e65504cd1d28dee7a7ab1c686d4d248c94e4","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639065600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639670400}","startTimestamp":1639065600,"endTimestamp":1639670400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, implement Patch 0.1e', 'No, do not implement Patch 0.1e ']","results":"[{'total': 11324657, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 635157.56, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

While this is short notice due to much of the team being off last week, we on the core team would like to propose that Alchemix use all 440,098 TOKE voting power on a CRV reactor.\n\nThe primary reason to vote for Curve is that the CRV token is more or less the backbone of much of DeFi and promoting its health and liquidity is beneficial for ALL OF DEFI. As of now, it has no direct pool2 incentives, leading to relatively illiquid markets compared to some of their counterparts with a pool2. A Tokemak reactor for CRV would help increase the liquidity for CRV and give CRV holders another source of yield, which would increase demand for CRV. \n\nOne interesting thing we learned from the previous reactor events is that even if you don't win, you can carry your votes onto the next round. So even with Alchemix's support, CRV is unlikely to win, but despite that, it would put them in a much better position to win the next round.

KPI options are synthetic tokens that will pay out more rewards if the KPI meets predetermined targets before a preset expiry date. \n\nNearly all DAOs created with Aragon are currently on Aragon v1. With the launch of Aragon v2, we're proposing to use KPI options to incentivise this upgrade.\n\nThese KPI options will be distributed to all Aragon v1 DAOs immediately after the option creation. At the option expiry, Aragon v1 DAOs will then be able to redeem their options for the ANT collateral in the KPI option contract. The amount of collateral they can redeem will be dependent upon: \n\n- The DAO's proportional share of assets denominated in USD relative to all Aragon V2 DAOs as of 30th June 2021\n- How quickly the DAO upgrades to a v2 DAO relative to other v2 DAOs\n\nThe proposal below includes steps for an initial test of KPI options. Should it be successful, we'd propose increasing the collateral underlying the option to a much larger amount and expanding the use of KPI options to meet other targets deemed important by the Aragon community.\n\n### **KPI option details**\n\n**Contract Dates**\n\nThe intended contract start date would be on the 14th April 2021 at 1pm UTC and end on the 30th June 2021 at 1pm UTC.\n\n**KPI Methodology**\n\n- The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) will be total value of assets, denominated in USD in all v2 DAOs by the 30th of June 2021.\n- The KPI options will only be distributed to all v1 DAOs created before this Snapshot proposal was published. \n- We propose to place the KPI option in a bonding curve to incentivise early adopters of Aragon v2.\n\n## Specifications\n\nWe will be undertaking the following community votes with the Aragon community to define the following inputs in the KPI option contract:\n\nVote 1) The value of ANT collateral (0 ANT - 150k ANT)\n\nVote 2) The upper threshold for total value of assets in v2 DAOs as of 30th June 2021, based on the value of ANT collateral (100 million USD - 1 billions USD) determined in \"Vote 1\". \n\n### ** Vote 1: How much ANT do you think should be allocated as collateral to this KPI option?**","protocol":"aragon","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x5799AEb17cBBC576b55288EDc2BD180d61E01dEd","totalVotes":19,"blockNumber":12136127,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aragon\/proposal\/QmXDBG7ZdCfg4fSRDhSwNSsdXggjsLapP9q3ijArysS56C","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1617105600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1617364800}","startTimestamp":1617105600,"endTimestamp":1617364800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['0', '50000', '100000', '150000']","results":"[{'total': 0, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 111.95007, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 38266.68, 'choice': 2}, {'total': 1782.4185, 'choice': 3}]","events":"[]"}

ANJ holders were not given a chance to signal their preference on the upgrade, and the decision to upgrade was made separately from the decision about what would happen with ANJ and Aragon Court if the proposal to deploy Aragon Protocol with ANT as the staking token was approved.\n\nBy putting this proposal on the ballot alongside other proposals to decide the future of ANJ and Aragon Court, both ANJ and ANT holders will have a chance during the upcoming poll and binding vote, respectively, to choose between all of the potential paths forward: merging ANJ and ANT, giving ANJ holders and Aragon Court greater independence, keeping the status quo, and various versions of each of these options that end up on the ballot. All of these options will be available on the same ballot, on equal footing, so we can get a full picture of the community's preferences with all potential paths forward side by side.\n\nSeveral arguments have been put forward in favor of the status quo:\n\n- The bonding curve relationship between ANT and ANJ ensures long-term incentive alignment while preserving short-term incentive isolation between Aragon Network and Aragon Court that cannot be replicated in a single-token system.\n\n- Related to the first point, with court jurors having a distinct set of incentives from ANT holders there is a better separation of powers that could lead to a fairer treatment of any disputes involving the Aragon Network.\n\n- ANJ's lower market cap can in some ways be seen as a liability (due to lower security in the short term) but in other ways can be seen as an asset (due to the relative ease of building a position and becoming significantly invested in the court's success).\n\n## Specification\n\n- Void the results of the vote to Deploy Aragon Protocol: [https:\/\/gov.aragon.org\/#\/aragon\/proposal\/QmcLGPwfJtbB1Bt384iyXaK65sxYTERSJuwqRDqLs5Chca](https:\/\/gov.aragon.org\/#\/aragon\/proposal\/QmcLGPwfJtbB1Bt384iyXaK65sxYTERSJuwqRDqLs5Chca)\n\n- The Aragon Association will continue to fund development, marketing, and distribution efforts for ANJ and Aragon Court.\n\n- The Aragon Association will advise the Governor Council to vote to un-pause the ANJ bonding curve and hand off control of the bonding curve and Aragon Court governance to the Aragon Network DAO once the DAO votes to accept this responsibility.\n\n## ANJ poll results\n[https:\/\/snapshot.page\/#\/anj\/all](https:\/\/snapshot.page\/#\/anj\/all)\n\n## Discussion\n\n[https:\/\/forum.aragon.org\/t\/void-the-results-of-the-vote-to-deploy-aragon-protocol-and-keep-anj-aragon-court\/2477](https:\/\/forum.aragon.org\/t\/void-the-results-of-the-vote-to-deploy-aragon-protocol-and-keep-anj-aragon-court\/2477)\n","protocol":"aragon","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xA1d4C9e0a46068AfA3D8424B0618218Bf85ccaAA","totalVotes":9,"blockNumber":11282870,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aragon\/proposal\/QmQtok8YQWcV9RTtDoDm5pGLVHmY3Uc4qADPmC5YDksTmu","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1605715200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1605888000}","startTimestamp":1605715200,"endTimestamp":1605888000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['No', 'Yes']","results":"[{'total': 76256.875, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1900.0072, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This separation was deemed necessary to isolate the incentives of Court participation from the incentives of other potential service protocols that might be created and connected to ANT in the future (eg Aragon Chain), and to ensure that the incentives of court participants were divergent enough to provide a check on the decision making power of a majority-rule based voting policy.\n\nThis structure positions the Aragon Network as a hub that deploys capital into the development of various connected protocols with the Court being one such protocol. However, it\u2019s our position that this is not a good path forward for the network as it splits focus and creates factions which must vie for resources and attention. We believe it would be much wiser to focus all resources, attention, and efforts into developing, promoting, and building tooling to support a single *Aragon Protocol*. \n\nWith a singular focus, the separation of rights between ANJ and ANT become unnecessary. We do not need to worry about isolating incentives across multiple potential protocols, and can tune Aragon Protocol using time-based staking parameters to ensure there is sufficient divergence among participants in the protocol and the larger population of ANT holders participating in governance. \n\n# Specification\n\nIf this vote is approved:\n\n- Aragon One will audit and deploy an upgraded version of the original court protocol with some added enhancements such as modified time-based staking parameters, ruling delegation for cold\/hot wallet setups, a more flexible payments system (giving the AN DAO ability to introduce custom payment models at runtime), and an improved upgrading process. Aragon One expects, but doesn't commit to, Aragon Protocol to be live and operational before the end of 2020.\n- Aragon One will decide the initial parametrization of Aragon Protocol with its governor being the [interim governance council](https:\/\/client.aragon.org\/#\/network) of the Aragon Network; the council commits to setup a vote for that transfer of power when the Aragon Network DAO is ready. Although Aragon One will choose parameters at its own discretion, the conditions to become a guardian will be similar to those for becoming a juror under the old Aragon Court protocol rules.\n- Aragon One's deployed instance will be referred to as Aragon Protocol and will use ANT as its staking token.\n- Aragon Govern will use Aragon Protocol as its default resolver for optimistic vote challenges and subjective disputes over votes. Other products and projects developed by Aragon One paid for by Aragon Association grants will use Aragon Protocol if there's a need for a subjective oracle.\n- Aragon One will immediately stop maintaining Aragon Court, and instead focus on building and enhancing Aragon Protocol.\n- Aragon One will shut down all infrastructure supporting Aragon Court no less than 45 days from this vote being approved.

Aragon One will continue its work developing community-driven projects like Optimistic Snapshot and other Ethereum centric scaling solutions.\n\n# Rationale\nAragon Chain was originally announced in October 2019 and funded by the Aragon Association after ANT holders signalled their approval on AGP-106. Since the proposal was approved Aragon Chain\u2019s development has mostly consisted of developing Ethermint itself. \n\nThe main motivation for Aragon Chain was to allow Aragon organizations to operate more affordably by reducing the cost of transaction fees otherwise incurred on Ethereum mainnet. During that time we have seen alternatives like xDai, that provide similar cost savings, gain significant traction within the community. \n\nWe\u2019ve also seen off-chain voting solutions like Snapshot quickly become the scalable and low cost voting standard on Ethereum. Emerging L2 solutions like Optimistic Snapshot have quickly become the primary focus of Aragon One\u2019s development efforts and have attracted huge interest from projects in the community.\n\nWe believe the Aragon community and its resources should go towards collaboration on these solutions within the broader Ethereum community, rather than building a standalone Aragon Chain.\n\nThis proposal does not intend to permanently close the door to an Aragon-specific chain. We aim to maintain our close relationship with ChainSafe and stay up-to-date on opportunities for developing an Aragon-specific chain, if and when it makes sense.\n\nWe still believe that Aragon\u2019s tools should be available everywhere, including Ethermint, which we propose should be made available on the soon-to-be-announced Ethermint Chain.\n\n# Specification\nThe poll for this proposal will be held on Snapshot for 48 hours with a 50% approval threshold and no quorum.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, the following will be enacted:\n- ChainSafe and Aragon One discontinue the development of Aragon Chain and ARA.\n- ChainSafe will deploy and maintain Aragon\u2019s tooling to the upcoming Ethermint chain.\n- Aragon One will monitor opportunities for deploying an ANT-linked Aragon chain in the future.\n- Aragon One will continue to support community driven scaling solutions like Optimistic Snapshot and other sidechains where applicable.\n","protocol":"aragon","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xf08b64258465A9896691E23caaF9E6C830ec4b9D","totalVotes":36,"blockNumber":11106600,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/aragon\/proposal\/QmWXJvo5zXA2uSgMMCLSyFgwxnpHKP2D7NM4RqDriNjEwo","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1603202400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1603375200}","startTimestamp":1603202400,"endTimestamp":1603375200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 0, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 0, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Those items will be addressed later via a future BIP.\n\nSpecifics:\n-\n\\\n**Upgrade all affected Setts with the following new functionality:**\n\n* add **rescue function** to transfer sett tokens from attacker wallets to recovered.badgerdao.eth (one time use - patchBalance() function)\n* add a \u2018**global pause**\u2019 feature that allows all Sett contracts to be paused and unpaused simultaneously with the same permissions as current pausing functionality\n* add global **blacklist** to block actions, set to the attackers wallets listed below\n\n**Blacklisted Attacker wallets:**\n\n* 0x1FCdb04d0C5364FBd92C73cA8AF9BAA72c269107\n* 0xa33B95ea28542Ada32117B60E4F5B4cB7D1Fc19B\n* 0x4fbf7701b3078B5bed6F3e64dF3AE09650eE7DE5\n* 0x1B1b391D1026A4e3fB7F082ede068B25358a61F2\n* 0xEcD91D07b1b6B81d24F2a469de8e47E3fe3050fd\n* 0x691dA2826AC32BBF2a4b5d6f2A07CE07552A9A8E\n* 0x91d65D67FC573605bCb0b5E39F9ef6E18aFA1586\n* 0x0B88A083dc7b8aC2A84eBA02E4acb2e5f2d3063C\n* 0x2eF1b70F195fd0432f9C36fB2eF7C99629B0398c\n* 0xbbfD8041EbDE22A7f3e19600B4bab4925Cc97f7D\n* 0xe06eD65924dB2e7b4c83E07079A424C8a36701E5\n\n**NOTE**: Approval to execute the following actions will be submitted via a future BIP that will undergo the Badger Governance Process:\n\n* Execute the new patchBalances() function to rescue funds from the attacker to the recovery multisig\n* Unpausing the Sett contract to resume normal operation\n\nWhy is this BIP being expedited?\n-\n\\\nBadger is committed to reopening smart contracts as soon as it is safe to do so. Given the timelock considerations, waiting for the standard timeframe before making these upgrades would add a minimum 3 day lag once the final BIP to execute the proposed actions to rescue funds and unpause is decided.\n\nAs such, this proposal uncouples the smart contract upgrades from the execution of the rescue action and unpausing so that the execution decision can follow Badger\u2019s governance process, while also ensuring the resulting governance decision can be enacted promptly.\n\nAmended requirements to pass expedited governance proposal:\n-\n\\\nGiven this BIP will go directly to snapshot, it will require a supermajority of over 70% at a quorum of more than 200,000 votes in order to pass.\n\nSupporting Parameter Changes:\n-\n\\\nAdditionally, among the older contracts, 1 Sett and 8 Strategy contracts have the Timelock set as their governance address. In order to align them with the rest of the infrastructure, Badger will change their governance to the [devMultisig](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xB65cef03b9B89f99517643226d76e286ee999e77).\n\nThis will give Badger the ability to handle unpausing and transferring tokens away from attacker wallets atomically and with agility, which is the preferred technical approach to the situation. Badger intends to propose using the timelock for all key parameter changes as part of the future governance 2.0 initiatives.\n\nNote that the timelock is still needed for upgrades or adding new strategies which are the critical operations that involve handling of user funds.\n\nThis transaction will require going through the Timelock process. Once executed, the unpausing of the whole infrastructure will be handled by the devMultisig directly and no timelock will be required for it.\n\nLink to the forum: https:\/\/forum.badger.finance\/t\/bip-76-upgrade-smart-contracts\/5173","protocol":"badgerdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x592F75a830Fd400C4f308388FDd6FEad5351e20a","totalVotes":498,"blockNumber":13781108,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/badgerdao.eth\/proposal\/0xd3360ea2f5e101b01ad3c80d04f2abeb38f8faee2ebba1ca791e8c1b360b7d7b","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639189800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639362600}","startTimestamp":1639189800,"endTimestamp":1639362600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 519284.28, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2.5, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

The community believes that there is further room for improving the tokenomics of BAL and some sort of staking\/locking should be implemented. Staking of BPT has already been proposed and approved by the community in the past[[1]](https:\/\/vote.balancer.fi\/#\/proposal\/Qmcyn5zdoGQs8nbo1nFroZiG2jWb8UEFPH9Y18cga3ESCJ). The current proposal contains details of a concrete implementation of locking BPT. \n\nTo avoid reinventing the wheel and spending additional time with non-core development, Curve's tokenomics[[2]](https:\/\/curve.readthedocs.io\/dao-vecrv.html) seems an obvious fit for Balancer Protocol as well. It has been battle-tested with billions of dollars and attracted a thriving ecosystem around it. \n\n## **Core proposal**\n\nCurve's ve (vote-escrowed) system will be used as an all-around solution for Balancer protocol tokenomics, solving at once a few outstanding problems the Balancer ecosystem currently has:\n\n- BAL minting is not automated and the inflation schedule is not yet locked forever. This reduces predictability and trust in the overall system.\n- BAL holders do not have any direct power over how BAL liquidity mining gets distributed.\n- Lack of a mechanism for distribution of protocol level fees, which have recently been approved by governance[[3]](https:\/\/vote.balancer.fi\/#\/proposal\/0xf6238d70f45f4dacfc39dd6c2d15d2505339b487bbfe014457eba1d7e4d603e3).\n\nInstead of pure BAL, BPT of the 80\/20 BAL\/ETH pool[[4]](https:\/\/app.balancer.fi\/#\/pool\/0x5c6ee304399dbdb9c8ef030ab642b10820db8f56000200000000000000000014) will be locked into veBAL, similar to how CRV can be locked into veCRV. This has the big advantage of keeping BAL liquid as well as setting a precedent for other teams to do the same with their 80\/20 Balancer pools. Alternatives to veBAL have been considered, like vebptBAL. The simplicity of veBAL \u2014 even though what is locked is not pure BAL \u2014 has however been the preferred option.\n\n### veBAL and governance power\n\nAll votes, onchain or on snapshot, will be done considering veBAL balances instead of BAL balances as happens today. This ensures long-term alignment as only users locking BPT will have a say in Balancer's governance.\n\nTo get veBAL, anyone will be able to lock BPT of the 80\/20 BAL\/ETH pool for any amount of time between 1 week and 1 year. Notice this is a change from the max duration of 4 years initially proposed in [[1]](https:\/\/vote.balancer.fi\/#\/proposal\/Qmcyn5zdoGQs8nbo1nFroZiG2jWb8UEFPH9Y18cga3ESCJ). This is proposed to allow for an eventual migration to a new governance system with a wait time of 1 year instead of 4. Of course this migration can only happen if the veBAL governance approves it.\n\nAfter locking the 80\/20 BAL\/ETH BPT, the user will have a non-zero balance of veBAL and will be able to help govern Balancer protocol, also benefiting from other parts of the new tokenomics system as described in more detail below.\n\n### New proposed BAL inflation schedule\n\nThe current BAL supply today (as of Jan 27th) is **47,470,000 BAL**. This includes BAL that is being vested by early stakeholders, the fundraising fund and the ecosystem fund. Please refer to the BAL launch medium post[[5]](https:\/\/medium.com\/balancer-protocol\/bal-is-live-104ba56e1945) for more details. \n\nSince the launch of BAL, the inflation has been a constant 145,000 BAL per week. To change that and make the Balancer ecosystem more sustainable, a new inflation schedule is proposed. Every 4 years the inflation should be halved, with gradual steps every year starting one year after the launch of the new tokenomics system. This would mean a final BAL supply of about **94,000,000 BAL.** A more detailed calculation can be seen on this public spreadsheet[[6]](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1FY0gi596YWBOTeu_mrxhWcdF74SwKMNhmu0qJVgs0KI\/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThis new inflation schedule will be immutable.\n\n### Onchain Gauge System to determine Liquidity Mining distribution\n\nCurrently, liquidity mining is done via a tier system approved by the community[[7]](https:\/\/forum.balancer.fi\/t\/proposal-balancer-v2-liquidity-mining-program\/1678). The distribution is fixed for tier 1 slots (it can only be changed via governance vote) totaling 60k BAL. The remaining slots are allocated by the Liquidity Mining committee, which is part of the Partnerships subDAO[[8]](https:\/\/forum.balancer.fi\/t\/draft-proposal-balancer-subdaos-formation\/2428). BAL token holders have no direct say in which pools receive BAL from liquidity mining.\n\nIn the new system, however, all liquidity mining BAL minted will be distributed through the gauge system. Gauges are contracts that allow LPs (liquidity providers) to stake their BPT (Balancer Pool Token) and periodically claim BAL from liquidity mining. \n\nThe amount received by each LP will depend on:\n\n- how much the pool they are providing liquidity to receives\n- what share of the pool's liquidity they have\n- the boost applied to their LP share based on how much veBAL they hold[[9]](https:\/\/resources.curve.fi\/guides\/boosting-your-crv-rewards#formula)\n\nEach pool receives a share of the total BAL minted every week. That share is defined by how much veBAL voted for that pool.\n\n### Gauge types\n\nThere are different gauge types that are used in the ve system, each type gets a fixed percentage of the BAL supply minted weekly. Within each gauge type there can be many gauges that share the amount of BAL sent to that gauge type. The following gauge types and weights are proposed:\n\n1. Liquidity Mining committee: 10% (14,500 BAL)\n2. veBAL: 10% (14,500 BAL)\n3. Ethereum mainnet pools: 56% (81,200 BAL)\n4. Polygon pools: 17% (24,650 BAL)\n5. Arbitrum pools: 7% (10,150 BAL)\n\nNew gauge types can be added and the weights\/percentages of all gauge types can be changed by governance. These changes are however not expected to happen frequently. \n\nGauge type 1) is an allowance for the Liquidity Mining committee to grant LM to strategic partnerships for Balancer protocol with the expectation that long term these partners will accrue veBAL to ensure they get LM through their own gauge. The LM committee should not accumulate BAL, that is, it commits to sending any unused BAL for any given week to the DAO treasury (not later than 7 days from receiving it).\n\nGauge type 2) is BAL that will be distributed to veBAL holders, similarly to LM that is distributed today to LPs of the 80\/20 BAL\/ETH pool. It is meant to keep locking 80\/20 BPT attractive as it helps veBAL holders avoid dilution and compensates for the impermanent loss risk of LPing. \n\nGauges 3, 4 and 5 will be LM that is distributed to mainnet, Polygon and Arbitrum according to the veBAL voting power each pool gauge receives from veBAL holders.\n\n### Initial gauges\n\nIn order to avoid the governance overhead of voting on adding dozens of initial gauges, all pools that will be receiving liquidity mining at the moment of system activation will be allowlisted. This however does NOT mean that they will have an initial percentage of LM. This will be defined by veBAL voting power.\n\n### Protocol revenue distribution\n\n75% of protocol revenues collected by the protocol fee collector[[10]](https:\/\/docs.balancer.fi\/getting-started\/faqs\/fees) will be distributed to veBAL holders. The other 25% of the fees will be kept by the DAO treasury as a reserve. This has been suggested by many thought leaders like Hasu, on his New Mental Model for DeFi Treasuries[[11]](https:\/\/uncommoncore.co\/a-new-mental-model-for-defi-treasuries\/). \n\nGiven Balancer protocol is permissionless and meant to have thousands of pools, fees are going to be collected in potentially thousands of different tokens. Some type of consolidation will be necessary for the fees to be claimable by veBAL holders in a meaningful, gas-efficient way. The fee consolidation prior to distribution will initially be handled by the treasury subDAO, but should be replaced in the near future by a fully decentralized smart contract implementation, akin to Curve's burner contracts[[12]](https:\/\/curve.readthedocs.io\/dao-fees.html).\n\n### Upgrading the system\n\nLike with Curve, the system will not be upgradeable. In case the veBAL governance decides for a new system, the way to implement it would be to abandon the current system and direct minted BAL to the new system. This can only be done with a 1-year time delay, which ensures that anyone locking BPT for the longest duration possible will have the opportunity to withdraw their BPT before the minter points elsewhere.\n\nThe inflation schedule however will NOT be upgradeable and will be fixed forever.\n\n### Benefits\n\nBeyond increasing the overall predictability of Balancer Protocol and the BAL governance token as mentioned above, there are many other benefits worth mentioning: \n\n- **Long-term alignment.** By locking BPT, token holders will be encouraged to support Balancer over the long-term instead of speculating short-term.\n- **Plug&play compatibility with Curve's ecosystem.** Curve has achieved tremendous success with a thriving ecosystem built around their ve tokenomics. By using the same system we make it trivial for teams like Yearn, Element, Convex and so many others to become part of Balancer's ecosystem too.\n- **Developer time\/effort saved for core Balancer work.** Tokenomics is super important but it is not what makes Balancer (or any other protocol for that matter) unique: precious development time should be focused on pool primitives and making Balancer easier to integrate with. Only this will help Balancer achieve the vision of becoming the leading liquidity platform for others to build on top.\n- **Motivation for other DAOs to take a position in Balancer beyond just token-swaps.** It has become common for DAOs and protocols to purchase CRV in the open market to make sure they have a say in the Curve Wars. By having protocols aligned with Balancer longer term we expect utility and usage of Balancer to increase as well.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Launching our own staking contracts (which are ready and audited but don't solve all the problems that this proposal does).\n- Using mStable rewards distributor or a variation of it.\n- Keeping status-quo.\n\n## **Risk assessment\/mitigation**\n\n1. **Immutability of the system will likely be a problem at some point in the distant future:** It's impossible to be at the same time predictable and upgradeable, so the trade-off chosen was that the system itself cannot be changed, but veBAL governance can choose to direct BAL inflation to a new system with a minimum 1-year delay. This is not expected to happen any time soon, but as things change hyper fast in this space, this system will likely not be the best option in say 5 years from now.\n2. **Platforms built on top (like Convex on Curve) can take over control with central points of failure.** We expect veBAL governance to consider single point of failures for projects that apply to have their smart contracts be allowlisted for locking BPT. Ideally only projects which let token holders vote directly with their voting power (instead of delegating all their power to a multisig) will be approved.  \n\n## Implementation\n\nThe main goal of the implementation is to change as little as possible from the battle-tested original Curve implementation. There could be some minor necessary technical changes that are necessary to adapt it to Balancer. The essence of this proposal or the parameters laid out however should not be changed.\n\n## **Voting**\n\nThis proposal will be posted on the forum for 1 week prior to voting. Voting will then be open on Snapshot for three days. This vote will be a single choice vote. You may vote on the Proposal by selecting \u201cYes, let's do it\u201d or \u201cNo, this is not the way\u201d.\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed with feedback and suggestions, also thank you to Curve for having created this great tokenomics system and also to the Yearn community[[13]](https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/yip-65-evolving-yfi-tokenomics\/11994) for inspiration for this proposal!\n\nI'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts and if you think anything proposed can be improved.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Beyond that, working groups like \u201cCommunity Dev\u201d also continue to be hard at work in service of the broader DAO.\n\nThis proposal is intended to outline the expected budget for Balancer DAO for the first quarter 2022. Please see a breakdown of compensation for February [here](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/balancergrants\/5f9e713ac0c740b5bf57e778afad1599?v=150f8cdf222e4c9cb35a6200d0466159). Ops will take a very active role in ensuring compensation accurately reflects contribution efforts for all DAO participants so it is possible for changes to occur at any time. For the purposes of this proposal, we will estimate March compensation to be the same as February. For January, Grants subDAO is covered on their compensation from their previous funding proposal. The January total reflects compensation funding needs excluding Grants. \n\n**5,900 BAL for January + 6,800 BAL for February * 2 = 19,500 BAL total expected compensation.**\n\n*Note that we will be running a DAO-wide Coordinape circle during February and March with an allocation of 2,000 BAL per month. This cost has graciously been offered as a gift from Fernando to the DAO, which we are very grateful for.*\n\nExcluding compensation, please see a breakdown of the expected budget for Balancer DAO for he first quarter [here](https:\/\/balancergrants.notion.site\/6ac72778504b4d6cad0541b3006e5b45?v=7d4a0ca953b54e5d889ce9fe15ae0a33). Ops will ensure an accurate record is kept of any disbursements - this will be presented as part of the next budget proposal so that token holders can make a more informed decision about the effectiveness of the DAO\u2019s expenditures. A certain amount of good faith is required for now since there is not much of a record to judge currently.\n\n**2,605 BAL for Q1 DAO Budget (excluding compensation)**\n\n**Specification**\n\nOps will always custody compensation funds to ensure that we can fulfill our mandate and to alleviate the administrative burden from the rest of the DAO. Ops also has the option to custody general budget funds as well. Given that the budget requests are relatively small, the expense of creating new multisigs for each subDao and paying gas costs is not economical. Thus, Ops will custody both compensation and general budget funds for the first quarter.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, a transaction will be initiated from the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) to send 22,105 BAL to the Ops Multisig (0x166f54F44F271407f24AA1BE415a730035637325)","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3","totalVotes":717,"blockNumber":14089817,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0xb48cbd0c8ecbd99315a6a21e0adade0cee6ac4452de60290cbe54c3c6c88c142","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643392800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643652000}","startTimestamp":1643392800,"endTimestamp":1643652000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes, let's do it\", 'No, this is not the way']","results":"[{'total': 160307, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 95.95034, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Traders on Balancer would then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found, eventually leading to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.\n\nAlso, joint marketing efforts will be made, together with a token swap, to align governance interests.\n\n## Abstract\nEven though GnosisDAO and BalancerDAO have common interests, their current level of collaboration and integration isn\u2019t enough to achieve their common goals. A partnership agreement would be necessary to increase the depth and breadth of their joint efforts, improving coordination and resource allocation to common projects.\n\nThis improvement proposal has already passed phase 1 in both protocols:\nhttps:\/\/forum.gnosis.io\/t\/treasury-swaps-program-gno-x-bal\/1440\nhttps:\/\/balancergrants.notion.site\/DAO-Agreement-Process-a871f46c41f043fd83bce34007eb14ab\n\n## Motivation\nWe believe that achieving a greater synergy between BalancerDAO and GnosisDAO would significantly strengthen both organizations, allowing for a more efficient planning and execution of their joint projects, backed up by healthier treasuries, with increased token diversification.\n\n## Specification\nBoth parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnership:\n\n**Technical**\nJoint work of technical teams of both DAOs to carry out developments in the best interest of both DAOs, such as completing Stage 3 of the Balancer-Gnosis-Protocol integration, so that Balancer users are able to place trades in GPv2 via their UI. Traders on Balancer will then always get the best prices available on-chain -or better- if CoWs are found. This will eventually lead to better prices for all traders of CowSwap as trades are batched and a higher trade frequency leads to increased chances for coincidence of wants.\n\n**Marketing**\nTo ensure both entities will profit from each other's reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where useful.\n\n**Token Transaction**\nTo align governance interests, a Token Swap between the two organizations is initiated as part of this agreement.\n\n200,000 BAL from the Ecosystem Fund would be exchanged for the equivalent USD value of GNO in equal proportions from DAO Treasury, using the 90 day smooth moving average price at the time that voting ends.\n\nBoth organizations commit to holding the received assets for a period of at least 1 year. No on-chain logic will be implemented to ensure this.\n\n## Rationale\nGnosis and Balancer have worked together for the past years. The protocols have [integrated Cowswap with Balancer V2](https:\/\/medium.com\/@gnosisPM\/cowswap-upgrades-to-final-version-by-fully-integrating-with-balancer-v2-21f4d635da1) to enable better gas prices and UX, MEV protection, no gas fees for failed transactions, better prices due to the optimized pool settlements and use of the Balancer v2 single vault architecture.\n\n**Partnership Term**\nThe Partnership is open-ended and does not have an expiry date.\n\n**Partnership Governance**\nThe partnership is managed by representatives of the organizations directed by the respective governance processes of the organizations. In the case of this partnership, there are 2 representatives for each organization.\n\n**Exit Clause**\nBoth organizations can at any moment terminate the agreement through their respective governance systems.\n\n**Communications around the Partnership**\n- A Partnership announcement blog will be created within the 2 weeks following the agreement date.\n\n- To ensure operational effectiveness, a monthly call will be set up with at least one representative of each entity\n\nBoth DAOs acknowledge that DAO agreements are inherently unpredictable and irreversible and agree to this initial partnership agreement.\n\n## Specification\n\nIf approved, the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would initiate a transaction to send 200,000 BAL to GnosisDAO (0x849d52316331967b6ff1198e5e32a0eb168d039d)\n\nGnosisDAO will send the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) 9051 GNO in exchange.

Quarterly cycles are used for budget allocation, reporting, goal setting and alignment across the DAO.\n\nA learnings and review document will be created by each funded subDAO at the end of each cycle. These documents will be compiled into one document by the Ops subDAO for posting on the forum. Any unspent resources at the end of the cycle can be rolled over as part of the budget allocation for the next cycle.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nProposal Template:\n\n\u200b\u200bhttps:\/\/docs.balancer.fi\/ecosystem\/governance\/governance-process\n\nBudget Breakdown:\n\n|Item|Amount in BAL|Description|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|1|100 |compensation|\n|2|200|events|\n|**Total**|**300 BAL**||\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT\/MITIGATION**\n\n1. subDAO\u2019s not held accountable\n\nsubDAOs could be formed that don\u2019t generate any progress\/ complete any work. Each subDAO is therefore responsible for creating a learning\/review documents for presentation to the community at the end of each cycle, informing them of:\n\n* Work completed\n* Budget spend\n* Learning for next cycle\n* Planning undertaken\n\nThe report will provide the foundation for the subDAO being funded for the next cycle.\n\n2. subDAO\u2019s operating outside of delegated responsibilities\n\nAny change to existing responsibilities ratified through this initial proposal will require the subDAO to present a Proposal to the community.\n\n**CONSIDERATIONS**\n\n1. The Grants subDAO and the DAO Multisig already exists within current Balancer DAO operations and their management practices won\u2019t change.\n\n2. Decisions made by subDAO teams that require on-chain execution will still be performed by a multisig.\n\n3. It's important to note these subDAOs are not the only ones who can contribute to Balancer DAO. As needs arise or contributors step forward, new teams can and will form in the future. Any individual or group can contribute to Balancer DAO outside of the formalized teams.\n\n4. There is agreement that formation of a Treasury subDAO is required to optimize management of DAO\u2019s treasury funds. This task requires a significant amount of evaluation, analysis and strategy. It is therefore proposed that the Treasury subDAO responsibilities will be restricted at the beginning, to allow further time to develop the underlying treasury framework. Future treasury function could include:\n\n* Tokenomics\n*  Reinvestment\n*  Diversification\n\n5. Delegating any new responsibilities (not listed in this proposal) into any of the subDAOs will require a new Proposal to be developed.\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**\n\n* Dec 2021 - Present draft subDAO proposal to community\n* Jan 2022 - Consolidate proposal feedback and post final Proposal + Vote\n* Feb 2022 - Structure + Budgets Live\n\nIt is proposed that the initial subDAOs (listed above) take full effect from 1 February 2022. This will allow a 2 month window for subDAO processes to be tested and refined before starting a quarterly cycle beginning 1 April 2022.\n\n**VOTING**\n\nThis proposal will be posted on the forum for 1 week prior to voting.

The structure that the program put into place was necessary at the time since the liquidity mining committee was just being formed. However its tiered system is very rigid and that rigidity causes some inherent challenges when it comes to divvying up liquidity across many pools with varying TVL.\n\nThe liquidity mining committee and business development teams have been working hard to onboard new strategic partners. Due to this influx of new projects it is becoming increasingly difficult to allocate incentives to new pools without impacting other pools in a meaningful way. This is due to the sizable changes in BAL between tiers. We\u2019ve seen over the past few months that smaller incentive changes lead to better pool retention. As a reminder these are the existing tiers:\n\n![|549x98](upload:\/\/oa5fqO2hG6VrXPYvYHbNI7GT4FN.png)\n\nAs you can see above it is a ~70% drop from Tier 1 to Tier 2, 50% drop from Tier 2 to Tier 3, and a 60% drop from Tier 3 to Tier 4. Current setup constraints in BAL allocation do not allow an efficient incentive model for prospective partners of numerous sizes.\n\nAs you may remember there were already two governance votes to switch to a more flexible model, those decisions proved to be successful and allowed the Liquidity Mining Committee to tailor specific allocations to projects depending on pool sizes:\n\n* Introduction of Tier 4 to add flexibility ([link](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/QmWiYnwdDynSJ66rt949E5nifh3CtYX6zYxTviiFMbXu3R))\n* Moving Polygon to a fully flexible allocation model ([link](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/QmQiatrqfsNZ4eSPCwBwaujBujwzhu2QqHEBSHqEoXs8g5))\n\nThis proposal moves even further in that direction by giving the Liquidity Mining Committee additional flexibility on both Main Net and Arbitrum.\n\n\n**Proposal**\n\n* Keep Tier 1 in place (no changes), any changes to pools in this tier would still require a governance vote.\n* Dissolve Tier 2, 3, and 4 distribution model on Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum and move to the flexible allocation model that exists on Polygon today. This change will provide the liquidity committee flexibility to allocate the 41,500 BAL ($726,000) on Ethereum mainnet and 8,500 BAL ($148,000) on Arbiturm.\n\nThis increased flexibility will allow the Liquidity Mining Committee to \u201cright size\u201d the incentives for respective pools. This change will ultimately lead to a better BAL per TVL allocation and spread liquidity across many places.\n\nAs a real world example let\u2019s take a look at the LINK\/WETH pool that is currently allocated 2,500 BAL. If the Liquidity Committee felt that the BAL allocation was better served elsewhere the pool would be cut by 1,500 BAL if dropped to the next tier. The APR for that pool would drop from ~12% to ~5%. Instead, what if you could trim the BAL by 200, 300, 500, etc. This freedom of flexibility will empower the Liquidity Committee with the ability to \u201cspread the wealth\u201d across our many partners. This change will also allow the Balancer platform to take a step towards a Curve gauge like system in the future if that is ultimately a desire of the community.\n\nThere are no suggested incentive changes for any pools as part of this proposal.\n\n\n**Risks**\n\nWe see no greater risk that Liquidity Committee members could mis-manage rewards than they could with the current structure.\n\nGovernance would continue to have the power to halt the powers of the committee at any time, or remove members from the committee if it deemed such an action appropriate. The need for committee votes to pass changes each week would provide several days for governance to intervene, were such an intervention deemed necessary.","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13984964,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0x80c00b537f85c325f9bd33affd1607c0a5d9430e38b511a9a2d5474f86701969","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641999600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642266000}","startTimestamp":1641999600,"endTimestamp":1642266000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes, let's do it\", 'No, this is not the way']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

Tempus is going live on Ethereum Mainnet on Wednesday 15 December 2021.\n\n## Background\n\nRecently, @Xeonus introduced a [proposal](https:\/\/forum.balancer.fi\/t\/proposal-activation-of-the-protocol-fee-to-grow-the-balancer-dao\/2304) to activate a \u201cprotocol fee\u201d on Balancer which was subsequently [approved](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0xf6238d70f45f4dacfc39dd6c2d15d2505339b487bbfe014457eba1d7e4d603e3) by the community.\n\nWhile this protocol fee does not immediately impact third-party pools, we wanted to discuss how this \u201cprotocol fee\u201d could be implemented in respect of Tempus.\n\nProtocol fees are normally collected as a percentage of the swap fee in the custom AMM deployed on Balancer. However, this would be counterintuitive for a variety of reasons:\n\n* Tempus is not a DEX, but a fixed-rate and future yield tokenization protocol where the AMM serves as a tool to indicate market implied yield.\n\n* Tempus has the ability to implement all different kinds of fees (deposit, redemption, early redemption, swap and performance fees). Swap fees (that will be set to 0% in the future, and replaced by other fees) represent a small part of the revenues and isn\u2019t representative of usage of the protocol.\n\n* Tempus is not charging any protocol fees right now; that is why implementing an arbitrary protocol fee (whether as a swap fee in the AMM or otherwise) would hinder the adoption of the protocol and the bootstrapping of liquidity.\n\n* If we apply a protocol fee in respect of swap fees in the TempusAMM, these protocol fees would start accruing in the form of our newly created primitives, Principals and Yields. It would add a lot of administrative and technical overhead on both sides to monitor the maturity date of each Tempus pool, and promptly redeem them (otherwise they will start losing value) using the DAO\u2019s 6-of-11 multisig.\n\nIn addition, it is worth noting that Tempus doesn\u2019t benefit from Balancer\u2019s features in the same way as other projects building on top of Balancer:\n\n* Tempus utilizes a custom version of the StableSwap implementation on Balancer (third-party pool) that uses a forked Vault, which doesn\u2019t allow for any straight fee collection mechanism by Balancer DAO.\n\n* Tempus can\u2019t tap into the liquidity of Balancer\u2019s Vault, since Tempus is built on a single AMM that allows trading between Principals and Yields only. There is no pair involving a stablecoin (e.g. USDC) or the underlying (ETH). We have no plans in place to set up new trading pairs as they are not necessary due to our protocol design and doing so would only fragment liquidity.\n\n* Tempus doesn\u2019t need its Principals and Yields to be tradable on Balancer\u2019s frontend, as it is a closed system, and trading between these tokens requires access to our valuation tools, which only Tempus\u2019 frontend can provide.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe are of the opinion that in order to foster long-term collaboration between Tempus and Balancer, we need to put in place an alternative plan that takes into account what Tempus does, and better aligns the interests of Tempus and Balancer.\n\nAs such, we are proposing the following:\n\n* On launch, Tempus LPs will not pay protocol fees to Balancer DAO.\n\n* When Tempus begins to implement protocol fees (deposits, withdrawals etc.), in a pool that uses a TempusAMM deployed via Balancer\u2019s StableSwap, Tempus will calculate 10% of the total fees accruing to Tempus Treasury \/ TEMP stakers in respect of that pool, and pay these to Balancer DAO in the form of TEMP tokens.\n\n* In exchange for this, Balancer will continue to support Tempus on an on-going basis, foster its integration into the Balancer Ecosystem, provide it with technical and marketing support, and treat the project on an equal footing with its other partners.\n\n## Why is this a better outcome than protocol fees for both parties involved?\n\n* It removes the complications of having to redeem Principals and Yields via the 6-of-11 multisig each time a Tempus series matures.\n\n* It aligns the long-term interests of Tempus and Balancer DAO as Balancer DAO will end up holding a small portion of TEMP and receive a corresponding amount of fees that\u2019s reflective of our protocol usage.\n\n* It gives Tempus the flexibility to put its users first, by implementing alternative fee structures that don\u2019t include a swap fee. In other words, it gives certainty to Balancer DAO that it will continue to receive revenues in the absence of swap fees in the TempusAMM. In this case, Balancer DAO can also act in the best interest of the Tempus users and Tempus will not receive pushback from Balancer DAO if we want to phase out swap fees.\n\n* It gives Balancer the ability to partner with and support Tempus in the long run, participate in governance and receive a share in its revenues using the newly accrued TEMP.\n\n## TL;DR:\n\n* Balancer DAO has activated a protocol fee in respect of their pools\n\n* It is counterintuitive for both Tempus and Balancer to pay and receive fees in this form, given Tempus is not a DEX but a complex fixed-rate protocol\n\n* When Tempus has fees (e.g. deposits, withdrawals, etc.) on a pool that uses a Balancer AMM, then 10% of the total fees would be calculated and Balancer DAO would be paid the equivalent in TEMP\n\n* The community needs to decide whether they will accept this proposal as an alternative fee structure","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3","totalVotes":1441,"blockNumber":13843331,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0xdc2fe80b988f091a29be8d4a7f46b2717ff12f7d08b089940eb3dbdbce6c3924","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640106000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1640365200}","startTimestamp":1640106000,"endTimestamp":1640365200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes, let's do it\", 'No, this is not the way']","results":"[{'total': 118942.29, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 176.7306, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Please let me know if you have any feedback on any of the below points.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs treasury swaps become more commonplace and now that the protocol fee has been turned on you should expect to see more yield farming activity coming from the Balancer DAO. In the vast majority of cases treasury assets should not just sit idly by, they should be put to work to earn yield while the tokens are in your possession. This is of course if the farming is done in a thoughtful, measured, and appropriate way.\n\n## Investment Proposal\n\nBelow I outline the selected strategies for the FEI, TRIBE, and MTA that the Balancer DAO recently acquired through treasury swaps with those respective protocols.\n\n### FEI \/ TRIBE:\n\n2,454,000 FEI was acquired on Dec 9 2021, worth $2,448,559 at the time of this post\n\n2,598,000 TRIBE was acquired on Dec 9 2021, worth $2,535,854 at the time of this post\n\nACTION: Deposit the full balance of both tokens to Rari Protocol\u2019s Fuse platform- FeiRari [Fei DAO Pool](https:\/\/app.rari.capital\/fuse\/pool\/8) TVL - $171,405,955\n\nESTIMATED RETURN:\nFEI - $81,292 (in FEI) annually based on 3.32% APY\nTRIBE - $718,407 annually (in TRIBE) based on 28.33% APR\nTotal - $799,699 annually\n\n### MTA:\n\n334,000 MTA was acquired on Dec 14 2021, worth $297,714 at the time of this post\n\nACTIONS:\n[Stake](https:\/\/staking.mstable.app\/#\/stake) the full balance of MTA on the mstable platform giving us an equal amount of vMTA. staked MTA TVL - $6,361,104\n\nVote on the [dials](https:\/\/staking.mstable.app\/#\/dials) page, giving 100% of the voting balance to the MTA\/WMATIC\/WETH Balancer Polygon pool. This will bring additional MTA staking rewards to Balancer\u2019s LPs in the Polygon pool. Note: the Mainnet Balancer pool is already capped at 10%, so no vote will be made for that dial at this time\n\nESTIMATED RETURN:\n$76,333 annually (in MTA) based on 25.64% APY\n\nOTHER:\nWe will not delegate mstable governance voting rights at this time. Rather the Balancer DAO will maintain the right to vote where it sees fit\n\nFor more information about the mstable\u2019s staking\/voting process see this [link](https:\/\/medium.com\/mstable\/emissions-controller-guide-4ceaf16199ac)\n\n## Risks\n\nThere are a few risks to highlight around the depositing of treasury held assets. By far the biggest risk is smart contract risk which could result in partial or total loss of assets. However we are choosing to deposit on highly reputable platforms.\n\nOne option to combat the smart contract risk would be to utilize cover from Nexus Mutual for the two protocols. Currently those rates are 2.6% annually for both Rari and mstable (rates subject to change).\n\nAnother potential risk is around a reduced return on investment of this proposal vs. other potential strategies. There may be other strategies that could be deployed, but more often than not a much greater return comes with more risks. We feel we can get a decent return with an acceptable amount of risk.\n\nDisclaimer: all figures and estimated returns are subject to change with market conditions, these figures presented here serve as a snapshot in time.\n\n## Specification\nFor FEI and TRIBE, deposits will be made using the \"Wallet Connect\" Gnosis Safe App from the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) and voting rights on the TRIBE snapshot will be delegated to 0xd6E96e437b8d42406A64440226B77a51c74E26b1 through the snapshot UI via \"Wallet Connect\".\n\nFor MTA:\n\n1.

During the pause period, the Balancer Governance Multisig has the power to gracefully pause the system in case vulnerabilities or issues arise. **Funds can always be withdrawn by users** , even during an emergency pause, and the pause is only to be invoked in situations where user funds may be at risk.\n\nSince gathering 6\/11 governance multisig signers during an emergency may not be feasible or expedient, we propose also **authorizing a Balancer Labs controlled multisig to pause the system** . The [BLabs Multisig](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B) will be controlled by a handful of team members at Balancer Labs. Note that after the 3-month pause period ends, neither the Governance Multisig nor the BLabs Multisig will have any pause power.\n\nAn important distinction between the pause mechanism in Boosted Pools and that of previous pool types and of the vault is that Boosted Pools are not supposed to be unpaused. In practice, after a pool is paused users should withdraw assets from the pool and a new pool should be deployed. In the event that the pause mechanism must be triggered, Balancer Labs will commit resources to draw attention from liquidity providers to the fact that they must withdraw their funds.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe Balancer governance multisig on Ethereum Mainnet ( `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` ) would submit a transaction to the Authorizer ( `0xA331D84eC860Bf466b4CdCcFb4aC09a1B43F3aE6` ) in order to grant the following roles to a Multisig controlled by Balancer Labs ( `0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B` ):\n\n1. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `AaveLinearPool` factory ( `0xD7FAD3bd59D6477cbe1BE7f646F7f1BA25b230f8` )\n2. the ability to call the `setPaused` function on pools deployed from the `StablePhantomPool` factory ( `0xb08E16cFc07C684dAA2f93C70323BAdb2A6CBFd2` )\n\n> 0xfcd7627e000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004000000000000000000000000002f35da6a02017154367bc4d47bb6c7d06c7533b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002bdac75576424959cffc7f91ec4674a05fd1c62bedcbcbce9dab046c58c8819505bcdcc8d471eea0c6345d3dd65ad4997a32054e1e0672b780a9b6c36df0166a3\n\nWhich is the ABI-encoded calldata for:\n\n```\nauthorizer.grantRoles(\n  [\n    0xbdac75576424959cffc7f91ec4674a05fd1c62bedcbcbce9dab046c58c881950,\n    0x5bcdcc8d471eea0c6345d3dd65ad4997a32054e1e0672b780a9b6c36df0166a3,\n  ],\n  0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B\n);\n```\n\nFor transparency\u2019s sake, a developer could reproduce the bytes specifying the roles above using this code:\n\n```\nconst ethers = require(\"ethers\")\n\nconst authorizer = new ethers.utils.Interface([\n  \"function grantRoles(bytes32[] memory roles, address account)\",\n]);\nconst pool = new ethers.utils.Interface([\n  \"function setPaused(bool)\",\n]);\n\nconst factories = [\n  \"0xb08E16cFc07C684dAA2f93C70323BAdb2A6CBFd2\",\n  \"0xD7FAD3bd59D6477cbe1BE7f646F7f1BA25b230f8\"\n];\n\nfunction roleId(address, sighash) {\n  return ethers.utils.solidityKeccak256([\"uint256\", \"bytes4\"], [address, sighash])\n}\n\nconst roles = factories\n  .map(factory => roleId(factory, pool.getSighash(\"setPaused\")));\n\n\/\/ Mainnet\nlet bLabsMultisig = \"0x02f35dA6A02017154367Bc4d47bb6c7D06C7533B\";\nlet data = authorizer.encodeFunctionData(\"grantRoles\", [roles, bLabsMultisig]);\n\nconsole.log(`authorizer.grantRoles(\n  [\n    ${roles.map(role => `${role},`).join(\"\\n    \")}\n  ],\n  ${bLabsMultisig}\n);`);\nconsole.log(data);\n```","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3","totalVotes":732,"blockNumber":13811099,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0xd5513dba656a2bfbc57bf0d3761cb2be8137507f7e7e30191634c50e87cb7734","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639590000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639849200}","startTimestamp":1639590000,"endTimestamp":1639849200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes, let's do it\", 'No, this is not the way']","results":"[{'total': 333536.44, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1.4823725, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

If the duration is too long, the pool can be arbed for all the interest accrued on Aave since the last update of the cache. A short duration mitigates this risk, with the downside of increasing gas costs for trades.\n\nOn Linear Pools, swap fees are not collected by liquidity providers, but rather act as an incentive for arbitragers\/keepers to:\n\n1. withdraw main tokens from the pool, deposit them in Aave and deposit the aTokens in the pool when it has main tokens in excess;\n2. withdraw aTokens from the pool, withdraw the underlying from Aave and deposit the main token to the pool when it has a low balance of main tokens;\n\nThe lower and upper targets determine a range within which no fee in imposed on trades between main tokens and Aave tokens. A trader moving the balance of main tokens away from this range pays a fee to the pool, which the pool then returns to traders that move the balance back towards the range.\n\nWhile we\u2019re confident that Gauntlet can hit the ground running with respect to optimizing the swap fee and amplification factor of Boosted Stable Pools, there\u2019s still much to be learned when it comes to the other four parameters described above. For this reason, this proposal would authorize a multisig held by Ballers to set those parameters. Balancer Labs would monitor the activiy on the pools and the market conditions and advise on the the best course of action, but Ballers would be the ultimate decision makers, acting on behalf of BAL holders. All updates would be announced in Discord beforehand.\n\n## Specification\n\n**[1]** The Balancer governance multisig on Ethereum Mainnet ( `0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f` ) would submit

The protocol fee would collect a percentage of the pool fees and passively accumulate them over time. The fee can be set in a range between 0-50% of the pool fee. The protocol fee is currently set to 0%.\n\n## Why should we activate protocol fees?\nIn the current state, the Balancer protocol provides around 145\u2019000 BAL weekly in incentives across the protocol (on multiple chains) without asking for anything in return. To me this was mesmerizing when looking at the overall distribution of BAL and co-incentives across chains. This is a good way to bootstrap liquidity and distribute our governance token. However, to be a sustainable and most importantly innovative protocol, we also need to collect fees as a revenue stream. As we want to transition to a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), we need to think about its future and how to achieve that. The only way to be able to run a successful DAO is the availability of funds to sponsor future development and innovation of the protocol as the vision of Balancer Labs is to slowly transition from a core component to a contributor of the protocol.\n\n## Impact of the protocol fees for trades\n\nAs a trader, you will not be impacted by the protocol fee. Each pool has the option to dynamically assign fees (e.g. managed by Gauntlet). The protocol fee would simply take a fraction of the already imposed pool fee to allocate to a treasury.\n\n## Impact of the protocol fees for liquidity providers\n\nAs a liquidity provider, you will be directly impacted as a fraction of the pool fee is not accredited to LPs anymore. Let me illustrate an example of how that would impact a LP position. I am using small numbers to more easily illustrate the impact:\n\nTVL in Pool: $10\u2019000\nYour LP position: $1\u2019000\nYour share (%) of pool: 10%\nPool fee: 0.1%\nProtocol fee: 10% of 0.1% \u2192 0.01% to treasury, 0.09% to LPs\nWeekly collected fees: $100 \u2192 90$ to LPs, 10$ to treasury\nYour fraction of collected fees without protocol fee: $10 (10% of $100 collected fees)\nWITH protocol fee: $9\nImpact: $1\nPlease note that Liquidity mining APR is not affected.\n\n10% of all collected fees are subtracted from the pool fees and allocated to a treasury.\n\nTherefore the impact for you is that you earn e.g. 10% less on e.g. 0.1% pool fees which makes up a very small fraction of your total incentives.\n\n## How will the protocol fees be utilized?\nIn an initial phase fees will simply be accrued in a treasury. There are many possibilities and opportunities to pursue once fees accumulate. The following non-exclusive list shall give you examples on what could be done with collected fees:\n\nCreate a DAO treasury index fund to secure liquidity and sustainability of the DAO\nDeposit accrued fees in Aave\nHave funds to grant talented Devs resources to build upon the Balancer protocol\nBuy back BAL and stake in the 80\/20 pool\nDistribute parts of the revenue to protocol participants e.g. LPs\n\nOf course, all these examples would only be implemented after careful consideration and discussion with the community and snapshot votes!\n\n## Specification\n[Mainnet] The DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) would issue a transaction to the ProtocolFeesCollector (0xce88686553686DA562CE7Cea497CE749DA109f9F).

The first session will be organized in mid-January.\n\n## Marketing\n\nTo ensure both entities will profit from each other\u2019s reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where applicable.\n\n## Co-liquidity provision:\n\nTo align governance interests, between the two organizations, the creation of a co-liquidity pool is proposed with the following details; 25,000 BAL from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund would be transferred to PrimeDAO at the end of PrimeDAO own LBP to bootstrap a PRIME \/ BAL pool with 50\/50 weights and 2,5% trading fees. Right after the conclusion of the PRIME LBP, PrimeDAO will seed a pool with the 25,000 BAL and match it with the same $ value in Prime. Once the pool is initiated, PrimeDAO will transfer 50% of the Balancer Pool Tokens to the Balancer Ecosystem Fund to complete the transaction.\n\nThe pool will again be called the Balancer <> PRIME pool (BLxPR) and function as a liquidity bridge between the two DAOs. The BLxPR pool will be one of the two main liquidity pools for PrimeDAO.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe BLxPR token will be added to the Snapshot strategies of both DAOs to allow BLxPR token holders to participate in the Governance of both protocols.\nA new snapshot will be set-up with the BLxPR as the governing token. This snapshot will be used to govern issues related to this DAO agreement.\n\n## Pool Optimization\n\nPrimeDAO aims to create deep liquidity between BAL <> PRIME to be able to bring more projects and liquidity to the Balancer Protocol. PrimeDAO aims to do this by actively engaging in D2D agreement with other DAOs and creating PRIME \/ xxx pools on the Balancer Protocol.\nPrimeDAO also aims to leverage the various upcoming Balancer Pools in combination with PrimeDAOs existing products. Prime Rating could potentially be utilized to create research-driven managed pools and Prime Deals could be connected to the Balancer Protocol to allow multiple DAOs to bootstrap a pool together in a completely permissionless way.\n\n## Specification\nAt the end of the PrimeDAO LBP, the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) will initiate a transaction to send 25,000 BAL to PrimeDAO (0x567d220B0169836cBF351DF70A9c517096ec9De7)\n\nPrimeDAO will match that with an equal USD amount of PRIME to create the BAL<>PRIME pool and send the DAO Multisig (0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f) half the BPT's.","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3","totalVotes":698,"blockNumber":13758402,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0x5d6694d2517841cb9831ea75ea7ba6d66fa123f1064fada2c7b8155682dc3ced","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638921600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639180800}","startTimestamp":1638921600,"endTimestamp":1639180800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes, let's do it\", 'No, this is not the way']","results":"[{'total': 397551.06, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 4657.6733, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

It is also a nice way to do a joint marketing campaign highlighting both protocols\n\n## Specification\n\na) Swapped amounts and origination\n\n-20k BAL against the equivalent USD value worth of MTA were agreed \n upon for this swap\n-MTA tokens would be sent from the mStable Treasury Asset \n Management subDAO ( \n 0x67905d3e4fec0c85dce68195f66dc8eb32f59179 ) to the Balancer -Treasury DAO ( 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f )\n-BAL tokens would be sent from the Balancer Treasury DAO ( \n 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f ) to the mStable \n Treasury Asset Management subDAO ( \n 0x67905d3e4fec0c85dce68195f66dc8eb32f59179 )\n\nb) Timeline and swap execution\n\nThis TDP will go to a Snapshot vote on the side of mStable on the 6th of December, and resolve on the 10th of December.

Its sole responsibility is to enact legitimately passed snapshot votes.\n\nThe current list of signers is as follows:\n\nAlexander Lange (Inflection)\nAsh Egan (Accomplice)\nSolarcurve (Baller)\nFabien (Snapshot Labs)\nJake Brukhman (CoinFund)\nKain Warwick (Synthetix)\nMariano Conti (Ethereum)\nDavid Hoffman (Bankless)\nTrent McConaghy (Ocean Protocol)\nCooper Turley (Fire-eyes)\n\nKevin Owocki (Gitcoin) will be retiring as a signer. We thank him for his service!\n\nAs part of this proposal a list of replacement candidates has been prepared. In the event a signer wishes to voluntarily leave, someone from this list may be chosen at the discretion of the DAO Multisig as a replacement. Any replacement will be announced in discord and the @Balancer twitter account.\n\nDanielmk (BeethovenX)\nBakamoto (Baller - Head of Liquidity Mining committee)\nZeb (Balancer Grants DAO)\nEvgeny Yurtaev (CEO at Zerion)\nHart Lambur (Co-founder at UMA)\n\nNote that BAL holders retain the ability to replace DAO multisig signers at any time and no one can be added as a signer without the approval of BAL holders unless they appear on the above list. Having the candidate list is intended to ease the transition period so operations can continue seamlessly in the event several signers decide to leave abruptly.\n\nAdditionally, a stipend of 500 BAL every six months will be payable to DAO multisig signers. They are free to opt out of this if they desire. The stipend will be distributed at the end of each six month period. If a signer leaves before that, they are eligible to receive it prorated. The first period will begin upon the approval of this proposal.\n\n## Specification\nIf approved, this proposal seeks to transfer control over Balancer DAO\u2019s treasury funds, located at 0xb618f903ad1d00d6f7b92f5b0954dcdc056fc533, to the DAO multisig address 0x10A19e7eE7d7F8a52822f6817de8ea18204F2e4f. All assets would be transferred by Balancer Labs to this new address.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO multisig signers would create a gnosis safe on Fantom to hold Balancer DAO\u2019s allocation of BEETS as part of the recently passed friendly fork proposal. Note that in the future the DAO multisig could operate wallets on other networks as required by future friendly forks or other activities - these would not require governance votes but addresses and activities will always be public and transparent.\n\nFinally, some BAL still remains allocated as part of past Grant waves. Balancer Labs will determine the exact amount but this is the reason not all BAL might be transferred over to the DAO multisig.\n","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3","totalVotes":821,"blockNumber":13728677,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0xadd41023d90e4e66bc1af834f7a3951b7c6171388d24f3779afed4ca9ad75a9e","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638547200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1638806400}","startTimestamp":1638547200,"endTimestamp":1638806400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes, let's do it\", 'No, this is not the way']","results":"[{'total': 472798.66, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

The music was formed over a 200 year reflection spent with a body decomposing in the nutritious soil and a heart and soul dancing among the stars and universes. The idea is simple; Build the best experience on Fantom, contribute to the entire ecosystem with everything we have in us, build creative highly effective edgy yield opportunities. When Beethoven lived the first time from 1770 - 1827 he was a rebellious creator of magnificent experiences that few people could follow. He was a true master, and now he is back; with his spiritually symphonic decentralised investment platform: Beethoven X. You can read more in this [Fantom Spotlight article](https:\/\/fantom.foundation\/blog\/fantom-ecosystem-spotlight-beethoven-x\/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=xkTxSQz34QjKbsVBfIgTqWZ.04YLYq7XnlvkXc9dW3E-1636051250-0-gaNycGzNCBE).\n\nAs a team, we strive to have well defined goals that drive our day to day efforts. As of now, those goals are clear:\n\n-Become the #1 DEX on Fantom.\n-Maximize the risk-adjusted return of more than 100.000 liquidity \n providers.\n-Maximise protocol revenue through constant experimentation and \n optimisation in close collaboration with the community.\n\nThe team and community behind Beethoven X truly believe in our capacity to become the #1 DEX on Fantom. We believe the technology powering the Balancer V2 protocol is second to none, and our strategy is to showcase its potential in a developing ecosystem.\n\n\n\n## Collaboration with Balancer\n\nWe believe that a portion of the Beethoven X protocol should be owned by both the BAL treasury and BAL holders, and so we\u2019d propose that 5% of the total supply of BEETS should be allocated as follows:\n\n-4% provided to the BAL treasury, with a six month cliff and two year linear vesting.\n-1% provided as an airdrop to BAL holders as follows:\n--A backdated snapshot will be taken for all BAL holders as of Nov 11, \n  2021.\n--Only holders with a BAL value greater than $100 USD will be eligible\n--A 2x multiplier will be assigned to BAL and BAL\/ETH 80\/20 BPT \n  holders on ETH mainnet\n--A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Arbitrum BAL and BAL\/ETH 60\/40 \n  BPT holders\n--A 1x multiplier will be assigned to Polygon BAL, \n  USDC\/MATIC\/WETH\/BAL 25\/25\/25\/25 BPT holders and BAL held in \n  the Qi Vault on polygon.\n--To achieve a more equitable distribution of tokens, the tokens will be \n  distributed based on the weights above, not based on the USD value \n  of holdings.\n--Any qualifying address will need to have at least $100 USD value \n  staked in a Beethoven X incentivized farm on Fantom Opera. A cutoff \n  date will be announced if the vote is passed.\n--The distribution mechanism of the tokens will be defined \n  collaboratively between the Beethoven X team and the Ballers and \n  the requirements outlined here are **subject to small revisions**.\n\nIf you review our [tokenomics](https:\/\/docs.beethovenx.io\/beets\/tokenomics) and [emissions schedule](https:\/\/docs.beethovenx.io\/beets\/emission-schedule), you will see that 5% of our maximum supply is a significant portion of our current circulating supply. It also equates to over 70% of our available partnership fund. This is how strongly we believe in creating a lasting collaborative relationship between both communities and teams. We know that you are what Mozart was to Beethoven; The greatest source of inspiration and the original creator of a foundation to create incredible music from.\n\nAs we launched our token prior to the definition of the Friendly Fork model, the Ballers have agreed to a one time exclusion for Beethoven X. The percentages above are not reflective of the requirements for future Friendly Forks.\n\nIn exchange for the BEETS, BAL governance will recognize Beethoven X as the approved Friendly Fork on Fantom, and we\u2019d propose that we co-compose creative ways to communicate the relationship.\n\nThe Beethoven X team will continue to search for avenues of collaboration with Balancer Labs. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to create tools and enhancements that could be easily integrated into the Balancer experience.\n\nWe truly hope that this is the starting point of a long lasting collaborative relationship.","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3","totalVotes":702,"blockNumber":13641105,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0x95db8e797145ad590b467f8dbecb23404c25c2a7090aa8a8d65428ad9f7373fc","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637348400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637607600}","startTimestamp":1637348400,"endTimestamp":1637607600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes, let's do it\", 'No, this is not the way']","results":"[{'total': 479174.2, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 5.871534, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

There\u2019s three elements to the handoff:\n\n1. Moving snapshot admin to a community representative\n\n2. Ceding control of the snapshot ENS\n\n3. Passing the burden of determining when soft consensus has been reached\n\nI will present my suggestions for how the community moves forward on this. My goal is to start a dialogue so please do not hesitate to question anything and everything or offer up alternative ideas.\n\n1. I have experience managing snapshot admin, so I humbly put myself forward as a volunteer to take the admin. I will remove the existing addresses capable of putting a proposal to snapshot and replace them with the addresses of the five full time Ballers - me, bakamoto, andrea, xeonus, and Mike B.\n\n2. I suggest setting the governance multisig as controller of the ENS. The only function they will perform is changing the admin, which should not happen often if ever. This multisig contains many high profile and trusted names in the ethereum community and is the safest place to put the ENS in my opinion.\n\n3. I propose creating a \u201cgov council\u201d of the five full time Ballers mentioned above. A majority vote in favor would be required before a proposal can be posted to snapshot. I can create a discord channel that is public read-only where the five of us will discuss if a proposal has reached soft consensus. It is extremely important to understand that it is not a question of if any of the five personally are in favor of a proposal, but that the community has reached a soft consensus to proceed. For example, if I personally oppose something but it is clear from forum discussion that most people are in favor, I would be obligated to vote in favor of the proposal going to snapshot.\n\nAdditionally, I suggest adding a requirement that each proposal include a forum poll as another signaling device we can use. It is gameable of course, but still a valuable input to have I think.\n\nFor a snapshot proposal to be considered valid & binding, it must be open for voting for at least three full days and announcements of the vote must be posted to the official @BalancerLabs Twitter account AND in the #announcements channel of Balancer\u2019s discord. These announcements must be made with no less than 24 hours remaining in the vote.\n","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3","totalVotes":709,"blockNumber":13641043,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0x3bbcaaad4f0a928b8dabaf97bfd9679752254aee6e63597df32a7453663354d6","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637348400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637607600}","startTimestamp":1637348400,"endTimestamp":1637607600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes, let's do it\", 'No, this is not the way']","results":"[{'total': 471787.16, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 3869.009, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

In the last couple of months, their project has helped drive more than $70m in trade volume through Balancer pools, and Balancer has successfully retained liquidity for the GRO project after its LBP on Copper. GRO has consistently been in the top few highest volume Balancer pools on ETH mainnet since its 80\/20 pool was deployed.\n\nSeparate to Copper Launch, the Alchemist team have developed Crucible: an innovative smart contract wallet, which enables users to subscribe to reward programs & store their tokens securely within an NFT container.\n\nWhen an LBP is completed, a key objective for Balancer is to retain the token\u2019s liquidity on an ongoing basis, so we become the primary liquidity for their token. Alchemist have proposed building out a feature which allows LBPs to convert into a standard Weighted Pool after launch, with rewards issued via their Crucible product.\n\nIn order to retain these pools after an LBP, we need a mechanism to be able to issue BAL rewards via Crucible, otherwise projects are liable to migrate to competitors who do offer rewards instead. In exchange for providing BAL rewards, Alchemist will offer Balancer as the only exchange to do a migration to after an LBP, within the Copper Launch UI.\n\n## Specification\nThe liquidity mining committee proposes that we run a 12 week trial, with Alchemist granted 2,500 BAL per week from Balancer\u2019s Ecosystem Fund, to distribute via their own reward programs, exclusively for projects which run LBPs.\n\nAlchemist will work with LBP projects to design appropriate reward programs, and each reward program BAL is used to incentivise will be matched by at least an equivalent $ value in the project\u2019s token (taken as the average sales price during the LBP for the LBP project\u2019s token, and a 7 day TWAP for BAL).\n\nThe liquidity mining committee will retain the power to veto:\n* Rewards for any post-LBP projects it believes may be a direct competitor to Balancer, or established to undermine Balancer in any way.\n* Rewards for any project it believes is not high enough quality to warrant BAL rewards.\n* Rewards for any project where the amount of BAL is deemed to be excessive, given the amount of liquidity likely to be attracted to Balancer by the program.\n\n30,000 BAL will be distributed from the ecosystem fund to a 3-of-5 multisig wallet, with solarcurve, bakamoto, andrea, mike b & xeonus (fulltime Ballers) as signers, which can then be allocated on to crucible reward programs each week.\n\nThe 2,500 BAL distributed each week does not need to be used immediately by Alchemist, and will accrue for distribution in future weeks if left unused. The program will continue for 12 weeks or until the full 30,000 BAL is distributed, whichever takes longest.\n\n## Dependencies\nNone.\n## Risk Assessment\nThe primary risk is that Alchemist mis-use the BAL. As a team committed to building for the long term, and as an important partner building on top of Balancer V2 which will want to secure rewards in the future, I see this risk as low. The 3 of 5 multisig wallet would be used as a mechanism to ensure any single rogue actor could not divert the funds intended for this program.\n\n","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x176001586fF17ad625Dc387557631710cf485f72","totalVotes":209,"blockNumber":13512919,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/0x00305705cf9c57b648729494c07224c5902bda5f1db5d2f95cf6ff510d7d850c","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1635505200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1635768000}","startTimestamp":1635505200,"endTimestamp":1635768000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Approve', 'Reject']","results":"[{'total': 268150.53, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2864.6128, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

See its previous proposal for establishing this committee [here](https:\/\/forum.balancer.fi\/t\/proposal-establish-the-balancer-grants-dao-and-coordinate-the-next-wave-of-balancer-community-grants\/2095).\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal aims to fund the next cycle (Nov 1st - January 31st) of Balancer Grants DAO. The upcoming program will further accelerate the development of the Balancer ecosystem by improving coordination around Grants, RFPs and Ventures.\n\nThe requested budget for this next cycle (3 months) is 50,000 BAL. Similar to the first Balancer Grants DAO proposal, a learnings and review end report will be created at the end of the cycle, and any unspent resources will be sent back to the BAL treasury.\n\nThe Balancer Grants committee has already worked together during the first 3 month\u2019s cycle. To maintain continuity and support for the grants that are still running, and the applicants that have applied, we want to have the proposal for the next cycle up and ready on time. The first round has been a success and shows the need and the potential for a bigger Balancer Ecosystem. To get a better idea of what has been done, check out our monthly reports on the [Balancer Community Notion](https:\/\/balancergrants.notion.site\/Grants-Updates-404ae3750a084de78116cb899b17e2b9). An end report for cycle 1 is being finalized and will be published at the end of the current cycle, which is running until the 31st of October.\n\nFrom the beginning we have looked at this first round as a time of learning and iterating, building on what works and leaving behind what is useless. With this in mind, the committee requested a lower amount than is often given to grant programs within the crypto space. Now that the committee and the Balancer community is aware of these learning points, the following rounds will no doubt go even smoother than this round already went.\n\n## Impact\nLooking back on the first cycle, we can say with confidence that the program has been a success. The program has been able to pull in multiple promising and established DeFi projects into the Balancer Ecosystem. To build long term relationships and grow Balancer\u2019s TVL were the main objectives, and the program is clearly delivering. We as a committee have identified multiple opportunities when it comes to ecosystem building and want to act upon these in the next cycle.\n\nEstablishing well-aligned yet autonomous units within the Balancer Ecosystem aligns with Balancer\u2019s Decentralization and Ecosystem strategy. Having multiple entities co-develop the Balancer ecosystem creates value-add opportunities and allows the separate entities to specialize further.\n\n## PROPOSAL\nWe propose some small changes to the current setup of the grants program, and advocate to further the decentralization of the BalancerDAO. We believe this can be done through multiple committees, initially funded by the Balancer Grants DAO. We understand that this is a slow and long process, so this will be a learning experience where we want to plant the seeds for the future.\n\nThe grant program provides support and funding ($5K - USD $75K, paid in BAL) to projects committed to supporting Balancer Protocol in achieving its mission to become the number one source of liquidity for DeFi. This program is made for groups and individuals that aspire to run a project that builds on the Balancer Protocol or supports the development of the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nThe RFP (bounty) program provides rewards for completion of key tasks identified by the Balancer community. It\u2019s the easiest way for anyone to contribute to the Balancer ecosystem. RFPs can be either technical or non-technical and vary in reward size depending on the required skill set and time needed to complete.\n\nThe venture program aims to expand the Balancer ecosystem and further align incentives with ecosystem partners through partnership agreements, token swaps and DAO2DAO ventures. We propose to start this off with a Venture Lead role who will be actively building out these types of deals and structures. With the actual outcomes going to the forum and being voted upon by the community. To support this opportunity, it needs some firepower and a dedicated role plus support can bring that.\n\nThe end-goal of the complete program is to attract and retain talent and resources to the Balancer ecosystem.\n\n## Snapshot Limit\nPlease view the rest of this proposal in Balancer's forum. The link is at the top of this page. The total ask in BAL is 51,000 and a full breakdown is available on the forum.\n","protocol":"balancer","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3","totalVotes":241,"blockNumber":13493561,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/balancer.eth\/proposal\/QmQzX6rbE2SJb7ebTdAxdACnwb2UAJqqw1hKzwnZr8SoEL","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1635422400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1635768000}","startTimestamp":1635422400,"endTimestamp":1635768000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Fund Balancer Grants DAO Wave 2', 'Do not fund']","results":"[{'total': 454849.34, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2397.3442, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Analysis of fee changes the DAO has made up to the present suggest we are still in the noise - in general, fee changes make zero difference to trade volumes, and understandably so. To a wide variety of users, the difference between a 0.2% and a 0.5% swap fee is essentially zero. More importantly, lower fees to drive higher volume is not commensurate with increased returns; Uniswap v3 has attained some truly remarkable volumes, but is currently running at a $20M loss.\n\n\nThe TRAC experiment finished and resulting data can be found in the data analysis governance post [8], and showed that a 1-4% fee resulted in more fees accrued compared to 0.2% and 0.5%.\n\nFigure 2\/3 show a decrease in overall pool volume and fees since the end of November. The pool liquidity (Figure 4) has also been steadily falling since the end of the end of November 2021. A proposal to deploy MTA funds in Fei Protocol & Ondo Finance [9] meant 418,797.01 MTA was removed on the 10th of January 2022 [10].\n\nThe pool currently has space for 2,918,641 MTA to be staked single-sided.\n\nIncreasing the pool fee will help siphon more profits from arbitrageurs to the protocol, most likely not affect volume and therefore increase APYs for the LPs in the pool and protocol-earned fees. The Bancor TRAC pool is a perfect example of such a situation (Figure 5 to 7). Increasing the pool fee significantly increased APY for all LPs in the pool, and attracted more liquidity making the TRAC pool the dominant source of liquidity for TRAC on Ethereum (89.1%).\n\nTherefore, an increase in the MTA pool APY might attract more liquidity to the pool. If the pool space is occupied, the MTA pool on Bancor would have the deepest liquidity in any Ethereum DEX. A trading liquidity limit increase can then be considered.\n\nThese reasons justify an increase of the pool fee, and the pool performance will be closely observed if the proposal passes to understand if a consequent decrease in the pool fee is justified.\n\n\nFor\n\n1. Increase the pool fee in the MTA pool from 0.3% to 1%.\n\nAgainst\n\n1. Keep the pool fee in the MTA pool at 0.3%.\n\n[1] https:\/\/app.balancer.fi\/#\/pool\/0xe2469f47ab58cf9cf59f9822e3c5de4950a41c49000200000000000000000089\n[2] https:\/\/v2.info.uniswap.org\/pair\/0x9241943c29eb0b1fc0f8e5b464fbc14915da9a57\n[3] https:\/\/v2.info.uniswap.org\/pair\/0x0d0d65e7a7db277d3e0f5e1676325e75f3340455\n[4] https:\/\/info.uniswap.org\/#\/pools\/0xc2d5acd2f49c0ab261c58de2da3a35a23a3abbb1\n[5] https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xb2f71da1b104EFae99A4BD824B27B2B102Fe3ECB\n[6] https:\/\/analytics.sushi.com\/pairs\/0x663242d053057f317a773d7c262b700616d0b9a0\n[7] https:\/\/info.uniswap.org\/#\/pools\/0xa96c549fa361181a94c081597171e17d27459dbb\n[8] https:\/\/gov.bancor.network\/t\/trac-pool-fee-changes\/3353\n[9] https:\/\/forum.mstable.org\/t\/tdp-28-fei-protocol-ondo-finance-laas-opportunity\/727\n[10] https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0x337eb91d6d48756398f87b62cb962a42a60b6a3eb7c5d526d847e09e9714e13b2","protocol":"bancor","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc26892F608B3E97A24149F9C273449416e222060","totalVotes":46,"blockNumber":14152422,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bancornetwork.eth\/proposal\/0x12108c6c364cf7f1785d86291f936b9624d2276feaeaec6c9508f0a2277605d3","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644156000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644426000}","startTimestamp":1644156000,"endTimestamp":1644426000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 5325531, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 284507.78, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 2031577, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

To a wide variety of users, the difference between a 0.2% and a 0.5% swap fee is essentially zero. More importantly, lower fees to drive higher volume is not commensurate with increased returns; Uniswap v3 has attained some truly remarkable volumes, but is currently running at a $20M loss.

The Bancor TRAC pool is a perfect example of such a situation (Figure 2 to 4). Increasing the pool fee significantly increased APY for all LPs in the pool, and attracted more liquidity making the TRAC pool the dominant source of liquidity for TRAC on Ethereum (89.1%).\n\nFor\n\n1.

The rETH token value is backstopped by ETH (based on ETH collateral) and its exchange rate continually increases against ETH (based on rewards generated by Ethereum PoS). The rETH exchange rate is updated daily by the Rocket Pool Oracle DAO. The Rocket Pool Oracle DAO is a set of bonded\/incentivised actors, made up of 14 high-profile members of the Ethereum staking community. Exchange rate updates require a 51% consensus. The top 10 rETH holders currently account for ~60% of the supply. These include a few large rETH investors (who have deposited ETH into the Rocket Pool protocol), Uniswap V3, and L2 gateways. Unlike most tokens, this lack of distribution is less of a problem due to the ETH backstop and liquidity provided by the Rocket Pool deposit pool. The Rocket Pool contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint\/burn capabilities.\n\n\n# Project\n\nRocket Pool is the first truly decentralised Ethereum staking protocol. Rocket Pool provides a liquid staking experience for Ethereum stakers; they do not need to run a validator, and they can contribute any amount of ETH. The rETH liquid staking token accumulates value against ETH over time. Simply swapping ETH for rETH (or buying it on a secondary market) provides access to Ethereum staking rewards.\n\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nrETH is the Rocket Pool protocol\u2019s liquid staking token. The token represents a person\u2019s stake in Ethereum\u2019s Proof-of-Stake plus the rewards generated over time by the protocol. Rocket Pool incentivises permissionless node operators to run Ethereum PoS validators. Each Rocket Pool node operator, brings 16 ETH that is matched with 16 ETH from the Rocket Pool deposit pool, to form the 32 ETH required for Ethereum staking. Node operators also lock RPL collateral as an insurance promise to the protocol.\n\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nRocket Pool has an active community on [Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/rocketpool) and [Reddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/rocketpool\/). The core team also operates an official [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Rocket_Pool) and [Medium](https:\/\/medium.com\/rocket-pool) account. Rocket Pool source code is open source, available on [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/rocket-pool), and frequently updated by the core development team. Rocket Pool\u2019s founder David Rugendyke has been Rocket Pool\u2019s spokesperson for 5 years and Rocket Pool\u2019s General Manager Darren Langley also represents the project. The core team is available for the community on Discord.\n\n# Available Audits\n\nRocket Pool has been extensively audited by high-profile smart contract audit firms:\n\n\u2022 [Sigma Prime ](https:\/\/rocketpool.net\/files\/sigma-prime-audit.pdf)\n\n\u2022 [Consensys Diligence ](https:\/\/consensys.net\/diligence\/audits\/2021\/04\/rocketpool\/)\n\n\u2022 [Trail of Bits](https:\/\/github.com\/trailofbits\/publications\/blob\/master\/reviews\/RocketPool.pdf)\n\nRocket Pool also has an [Immunefi Bug Bounty](https:\/\/immunefi.com\/bounty\/rocketpool\/) program in place.\n\n# Market and Trading Data\n\n* rETH\u2019s price at the time of writing is ~$2,438 \n* All-time high $4,814.31 (1st December 2021)\n* All-time low $2,068.89 (27th January 2022)\n* 32,546 tokens in circulation\n* Theoretical maximum supply of rETH is equal to the maximum supply of Ethereum\n* The rETH token is available on Uniswap (mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism) and Balancer (mainnet)\n* The 24-hour spot volumes range from $34k (Uniswap mainnet) to $148k (Uniswap Arbitrum)\n\n# Benefits for Bancor\n\nThe Ethereum staking market will continue to grow strongly, due to its relatively low counter-party risk. Liquid staking tokens are an important financial primitive in DeFi and have the potential to appeal more broadly. rETH is clearly developing, in terms of circulation and trade volumes, but it represents the greater choice in the liquid staking market. The project is widely known; its significant growth in a short time (370m+ in just 6 weeks) shows its potential as a leading project in the Ethereum staking market (Rocket Pool are already #2). Liquid staking tokens intrinsically fit into the DeFi landscape; as liquidity; as lending collateral; as investment vault strategies. Integration opportunities with other protocols are numerous and exciting. Rocket Pool has been active in the Ethereum community for over 5 years. During this time, it has developed a highly engaged community within Discord and on Twitter. There are certain marketing opportunities that mutually benefit Bancor and Rocket Pool.\n3\n4 \/ 4\n","protocol":"bancor","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc26892F608B3E97A24149F9C273449416e222060","totalVotes":44,"blockNumber":14152212,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bancornetwork.eth\/proposal\/0x367b23eabf0efacb2e19637282d19a01f85c92986057c5dfb9993a572e3f8b17","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644156000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644426000}","startTimestamp":1644156000,"endTimestamp":1644426000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 5428267, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2002917.4, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

If the pool space is filled, a proposal to increase the trading liquidity limit can be proposed, as there are two much deeper TEMP pools on Ethereum.\n\n# Token Security\n\nTEMP does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The TEMP token has a current total supply of 1,000,000,000 TEMP. Contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don't have admin privileges that grant unrestricted burning of tokens. Minting is allowed but is restricted to 2% of total supply per year.\n\nThe top 15 contract and addresses with the highest concentration of TEMP are Vesting and Proxy contracts, the Balancer TEMP\/WETH 80%\/20% vault contract, the Uniswap v3 USDC\/TEMP pool contract, team wallets, Hats Finance Vault contract, and wallets with 1.2510%, 1.2500% and 0.1801% of supply.\n\n\n# Project\n\nTempus is a future yield tokenization and fixed rate protocol.\n\nMost forms of yield farming return a variable rate of yield. This means that depositors can be subject to unpredictable fluctuations in their returns. Currently, there is no easy capital efficient way to obtain a fixed yield or otherwise speculate on the receivable rewards.\n\nThis is where Tempus steps in. Tempus has three different use cases, each of which offers a unique value proposition:\n\n1. Fix your future yield using any supported Yield Bearing Token (such as stETH, cDai).\n\n2. Speculate on the rate of future yield of any supported Yield Bearing Token.\n\n3. Provide liquidity to earn additional swap fees (on top of yield earned through yield farming protocols) by depositing any supported Yield Bearing Token.\n\n# Tokenomics\n\nTEMP is the Tempus ERC-20 native token. It serves three roles: governance, staking to receive a share in network fees, and paying protocol fees. 1 billion TEMP tokens were minted at genesis and will become available over the course of three years.\n\n### Governance\n\nTEMP holders can propose changes to the protocol via the [Forum](https:\/\/forum.tempus.finance\/) and [Snapshot](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/tempusgov.eth), including adjusting protocol-level fees, and treasury management.\n\nTEMP holders will also be able to vote on how to spend funds that have accrued to the Tempus Treasury.\n\n### Staking\n\nTempus will earn fees from underlying trading activity in its pools. TEMP holders will be able to enable fees on deposits, withdrawals, and swaps on Tempus.\n\nA portion of these fees will accrue to the Tempus Treasury, while some of them will accrue directly to those who stake their TEMP (Note; this is not yet released).\n\n### Protocol Fees\n\nIf TEMP holders vote to enable fees on deposits, withdrawals, and swaps on Tempus, TEMP holders will also be able to use their TEMP to pay for these fees (instead of paying in e.g. Ethereum).\n\nOf the 1 billion TEMP minted at genesis, 70M TEMP were sold (and immediately unlocked) in a fair launch auction in November 2021. The remaining 930M TEMP will unlock gradually. The Tempus team has a 36-month vesting schedule and investors and advisors have a 30-month vesting schedule starting after Tempus' mainnet launch on 15 December 2021.\n\nThe TEMP tokens allocated to the Tempus Treasury (for incentives for the benefit of the Tempus ecosystem) will also unlock over a similar timeframe. Token inflation of 2% per year can also be triggered by governance after 4 years. This is to ensure there is long-term development and community support available for Tempus.\n\n\nThe Tempus Finance treasury is currently valued at $59,263,190.60.\n\n# Community and Communication\n\nTempus Finance is active on [Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/tempuschat) and [Discord](https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/6gauHECShr).

To maintain liquidity in the near term, and to sustain liquidity while Bancor prepares new products and upgrades, wherein it is proposed to extend the LM rewards program on these pools for a further 8 weeks with conditions to stop if the V3 is released.\n\n1. ETH, LINK, and WBTC will continue to receive emissions of 100-200K BNT per week, for an additional 8 weeks.\n2. Upon release of the V3, a new LM incentives program may be considered by the DAO. Therefore the current liquidity mining plan will be stopped to incentivise migration.\n\n## Discussion\n\n1. Around 75% of tokens have been restaked back into the pools; therefore, the LM rewards have increased the space for single-sided TKN deposits, resulting in growth of the network, rather than creating a sell pressure.\n2. The above 3 pools hold the majority of the protocol TVL, therefore curation of these pools is essential to maintain the position of the Bancor protocol on the market.\n3. The 3 mentioned above pools drive most of the volume on the ecosystem, and also present reasonable impermanent loss liability.\n4. The pools should be curated until the new V3 design is released so the funds are migrated without loss of significant TVL prior the protocol upgrade\n\n## Summary\n\n1. At this stage, current protocol growth requires LM to maintain the momentum and stay competitive in the space (the DAO seems aware of this).\n2. After releasing the V3 and supporting the smooth liquidity migration, LM extension will no longer be necessary, and the voting for LM extensions may be concluded.\n3. A large majority of the LM rewards are re-staked to the protocol, increasing the TVL and the space available for TKN deposits with single sided exposure. If this trend continues, the LM program is more of an asset than a liability, and can be managed more assertively.\n4. In the long term, Bancor is aiming towards sustainable annual inflation of 4%, in order to achieve that, Bancor requires significant volume and Vortex to be applied.\n5. **Extension of LM rewards on ETH, WBTC and LINK for 8 weeks will provide 1,200,000 - 2,400,000 BNTs as rewards, (depends on the multiplier).\n\nThis proposal is very similar to the one here: Proposal: Extend Liquidity Mining for BTC\/ETH\/LINK 2 and Proposal: Extend Liquidity Mining Rewards for WBTC, LINK and ETH pools. The arguments in favour of LM extension for the large caps pools then are still valid for a recent LM extension.","protocol":"bancor","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc26892F608B3E97A24149F9C273449416e222060","totalVotes":50,"blockNumber":14152180,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bancornetwork.eth\/proposal\/0xc1876dcca2ca0cb66eeb846685a8925e0322b5040088dd4b8e532b01b6a71098","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644156000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644426000}","startTimestamp":1644156000,"endTimestamp":1644426000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 5147658.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 381308.5, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 2197263.5, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

A new pool for the new RSR token contract should be created and whitelisted so the liquidity can migrate.\n* Currently the RSR pool has a trading liquidity limit of 750,000. The suggested trading liquidity limit for the new RSR pool is 750,000.\n\n#### OLD Contract Address : 0x8762db106B2c2A0bccB3A80d1Ed41273552616E8\n\n#### NEW Contract Address: 0x320623b8e4ff03373931769a31fc52a4e78b5d70\n\n#### Project Website: https:\/\/reserve.org\/\n\n\n# **Project Info**\nReserve is a dual-token stablecoin platform that was launched in May 2019 following a successful initial exchange offering (IEO) on the Huobi Prime platform. The projects is backed by investors such as Peter Thiel (PayPal), Sam Altman (YCombinator), Coinbase & Digital Currency Group.\n\nThe Reserve ecosystem will initially consist of two stablecoins, one purely backed by a basket of USD fiatcoins (USDC, TUSD & USDP), and the second backed by DeFi-yield bearing tokens (e.g. cUSDC, aDAI, cBUSD). Both of these will be used by the Reserve app customer base in Latin-America as a means of escaping the hyperinflating local currencies of countries such as Venezuela & Argentina. The Reserve app currently already has 450,000+ customers who pay for their daily expenses (groceries, bills, food delivery, \u2026) at 10,000+ merchants or service providers with our Reserve stablecoins.\n\nUltimately, Reserve aims to create a non-sovereign stablecoin that will be backed by 50+ assets across asset classes & jurisdictions. With the right configuration of assets, this currency could become non-inflatable and more robust than any existing fiat currency. Citizens of countries that experience higher-than-normal inflation rates can then fall back on this global decentralized reserve currency.\n\nReserve Rights (RSR) is the secondary, and volatile, token of the Reserve Protocol. It serves as (a) a backstop in case any of the collateral of Reserve stablecoins defaults and (b) the governance token of Reserve stablecoins.\n\nReserve Rights owner can stake their tokens on Reserve stablecoins, thereby earning a portion of the revenue that stablecoin earns.\n\n# **Token Security**\n\nThe new RSR token does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The new contracts are standard ERC-20 OpenZeppelin contracts. The contracts don\u2019t have any permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint\/burn capabilities.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/reserveprotocol\/status\/1481796233911955456\n\nFOR\nCreate new RSR pool with 750,000 BNT trading liquidity limit.\n\nAGAINST\nDo nothing.\n","protocol":"bancor","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc26892F608B3E97A24149F9C273449416e222060","totalVotes":44,"blockNumber":14106620,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bancornetwork.eth\/proposal\/0x1cbe15325cd4bdd1211ec10101edf24127c4c896ec24d4fbde8a66bd503c0fbf","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643551200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643821200}","startTimestamp":1643551200,"endTimestamp":1643821200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 5012945.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2000243.4, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

If the pool is filled, a new trading liquidity limit increase may be proposed.\n\n### Rationale\n\n#### DEX liquidity on Ethereum\n\nThe CHZ pools with deepest liquidity in Ethereum DEXes are:\n\n* The CHZ\/USDT 0.3% pool on Uniswap v3 with $1.48m liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 21.93% [1].\n* The CHZ\/ETH 1% pool on Uniswap v3 with $364.86k liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 3.39% [2].\n* The CHZ\/ETH pool on Uniswap v2 with $109,356 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 7.93% [3].\n* The CHZ 0.2% pool on Bancor with $97,374 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 1.19% [4].\n\nThe extra liquidity would bring the total pool liquidity to at least $237k if it is full, with BNT at $2.37.\n\n#### Volume and fee performance\n\nCHZ pool weekly Volume and Fees are presented in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.\n\nhttps:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard20\/uploads\/bancordao\/optimized\/2X\/0\/0a0a32e1ebd1fbf0786f00e22649beaf242e6e81_2_1035x259.jpeg\nFigure 2 - CHZ weekly volume since the end of August.\n\nhttps:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard20\/uploads\/bancordao\/optimized\/2X\/8\/8cd2e5843677a94a780006d872af3af7ba05f1a4_2_1035x258.jpeg\nFigure 3 - CHZ weekly fees since the end of August.\n\nThe pool would benefit from a larger trading liquidity limit to reduce swap price impact, increase volume\/fees and thus improve APY.\n\nFOR\n\nIncrease trading liquidity in the CHZ pool from 20k BNT to 50k BNT.\n\nAGAINST\n\nKeep the trading liquidity in the CHZ pool at 20k BNT.\n\n[1] https:\/\/info.uniswap.org\/#\/pools\/0xb0f4a77bde7fee134265307c5cc19abff0ba409b\n[2] https:\/\/info.uniswap.org\/#\/pools\/0x325365ed8275f6a74cac98917b7f6face8da533b\n[3] https:\/\/v2.info.uniswap.org\/pair\/0xff58711683be66dad6e0e20e0043af46fc7f5f49\n[4] https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x6680728F13BebA75ae30cC2ea4e0C148aD59Ad32","protocol":"bancor","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc26892F608B3E97A24149F9C273449416e222060","totalVotes":44,"blockNumber":14106611,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bancornetwork.eth\/proposal\/0xd7c9ebf9f06aefbf6540183f18615cb637c882b2353779bc71a361e6aff8ba47","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643551200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643821200}","startTimestamp":1643551200,"endTimestamp":1643821200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 4986597, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2028660.8, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

Make sure to stake your vBNT for voting before this date and time to participate in the DAO decision.\n\n### TL;DR\n\n* There is currently a discussion in the #treasury-management channel on the WOO Discord about staking WOO DAO Treasury funds on Bancor. According to WOO DAO guidelines, discussion can result in a WRC (WOO Request for Comment), and finally a WIP (WOO Improvement Proposal).\n* The pool doesn't currently have significant space for WOO DAO treasury funds to be staked if a WIP passes. In any case, the pool would greatly benefit from an increase in the available space for WOO to be staked single-sided.\n* This proposal seeks to increase the trading liquidity limit in the WOO pool from 750k BNT to 1M BNT. If the pool is filled, a new trading liquidity limit increase may be proposed.\n* The pool has space for 215,129 WOO to be staked single-sided and is the second deepest WOO pool on Ethereum.\n\n### Rationale\n\n#### DEX liquidity on Ethereum\n\nThe WOO pools with deepest liquidity in Ethereum DEXes are:\n\n* The WOO\/ETH 0.3% pool on Uniswap v2 with $9,372,838 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 13.55% [1].\n* The WOO 0.2% pool on Bancor with $7,574,455 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 3.38% [2]\n* The WOO\/ETH 0.3% pool on Uniswap v3 with $2.04m liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 3.77% [3].\n* The WOO\/USDC 0.3% pool on Uniswap v3 with $642.18k liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 0.00% [4].\n* The WOO\/USDC 0.3% pool on Sushiswap with $589,578.75 liquidity, and an extrapolated APY from the fees accrued in the past 24 hours of 12.06% [5].\n\nThe extra space in the pool would allow for an additional 928,217 WOO (~$600,000) to be staked single-sided, with BNT at $2.40 and WOO at $0.6464.\n\nThe pool has space for 215,129 WOO (~$139,059) to be staked single-sided.

Balancer has awarded to BanklessDAO an educational grant and has launched a liquidity BANK\/WETH pool 1 on Ethereum. Recently, Balancer has launched a BANK\/WETH pool 3 on Polygon.\n\n**MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT**\n\nThe mission of BanklessDAO is to help the world go Bankless by creating user-friendly onramps for people to discover decentralized financial technologies. Due to its characteristics, Balancer is the perfect example of a DeFi project which could help the world go Bankless, in allowing to create liquidity and to earn from assets which are deposited in the Balancer\u2019s pool. Moreover, in launching its DAO, Balancer - in line with the more advanced web 3.0 culture - demonstrates the willingness of decentralizing its operations.\n\nMoreover, this type of collaboration demonstrates that BanklessDAO has reached a mature status, where projects show up and demand for client services. In the future, sponsorships and paid services will make our DAO financially sustainable.\n\n**SPECIFICATION \/ BUDGET**\n\n1. Polygon BANK\/WETH liquidity pool incentives and BanklessDAO Newsletter sponsorship\n\nBanklessDAO is requested to deposit in the BANK\/WETH 80\/20 Polygon liquidity pool:\n\n4M BANK\n\n14 WETH\n\nBalancer will grant for the entire 2022 a weekly reward of 300 BAL (apx. 5k USD) for depositors. It means that if, for instance, BanklessDAO holds 50% of the liquidity in the pool, a revenue of 10k USD in BAL will be granted to the DAO treasury on a monthly basis (as 1200 BAL per month have a value of apx. 20k USD).\n\nAs consideration of the pool incentives, BanklessDAO will host BalancerDAO as the main sponsor on the \u201cWeekly Roll-up\u201d newsletter or the \u201cState of the DAOs\u201d newsletter for the entire 2022. The precise collocation of Balancer\u2019s sponsorship will be determined on a seasonal basis.\n\n2. BalancerDAO\u2019s grant for media coverage\n\nBalancerDAO would like to award to BanklessDAO a grant of 7k USD in BAL for:\n\nA medium post where the collaboration between Market and BanklessDAO will be announced (500 USD)\n\n2 medium articles, which will be tweeted 2 times by the BanklessDAO account and that will be mentioned in the weekly roll-up. (2,500 USD)\n\nArticle 1: The Multi-chain Strategy of Balancer\n\nArticle 2: The Creation of the Balancer DAO (with a short version in the State of the DAOs DAO Spotlight section)\n\nA Crypto-Sapiens Podcast where the founders will present the Balancer DAO (2,000 USDC)\n\nA strong marketing campaign concerning the liquidity pools (4 tweets with graphics prepared by designers) (1,000 USD)\n\n1,000 USD for the project champions\n\n**FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS**\n\nIn order to get the pool incentives on a yearly basis, BanklessDAO is requested to deposit in the BANK\/WETH 80\/20 Polygon liquidity pool:\n\n4M BANK\n\n14 WETH\n\n:warning: Funding should be provided by the BanklessDAO treasury\n\nAs to the media coverage, Balancer will cover the entire costs.\n\n**BRAND USAGE**\n\nEvery published item will present BalancerDAO and BanklessDAO logos together.\n\n**SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS**\n\nSuccess will be evaluated from the number of views of the articles, the likes of the tweets and from the number of the participants at the podcast and at the workshop.\n\nMoreover, Balancer will also evaluate whether the media coverage has brought an increment in the usage of the BANK\/WETH liquidity pools.\n\n**NEXT STEPS**\n\nThe proposal requires a snapshot vote.\n\nIn case of approval, the champion of the proposal will organize the teams to cover the planned work.\n\nWriters\u2019 Guild Client Services will organize the written content and the publication on Medium. BalancerDAO\u2019s founders will be put in contact with representatives of Crypto-Sapiens in order to organize the podcast.\n\n**SQUAD BACKGROUND**\n\n@Eagle is the Legal Guild Coordinator and member of the Grants Committee. He is a Law Professor and Lawyer interested in blockchain technology, DAO governance and DeFi\n\n@Grendel is the Translator Guild Coordinator and member of the Grants Committee. He is a IT entrepreneur who designs and implements fungible and non-fungible tokenization blockchain projects.\n\n@andrea Balancer is a Balancer core contributor and marketing strategist\n\n@siddhearta is the Bankless DAO Newsletter Coordinator.\n","protocol":"banklessvault","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x47f882a155209F55D280EB36577c100A74DD32a1","totalVotes":192,"blockNumber":14050457,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/banklessvault.eth\/proposal\/QmU1Rz7s87ow29QsfeCee7j2jr7H9h6BFkoPmVu6Ux56XD","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642789800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643394600}","startTimestamp":1642789800,"endTimestamp":1643394600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 17064440, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 50, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

A close comparable is the original [Season Specification ](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/t\/draft1-banklessdao-season-1-proposal\/904) that continues to act as an important cornerstone in our governance model.\n\nAs such, this proposal calls for:\n\n* Five elected members of the DAO to lead these two problem spaces, known as Governance Solutions Engineers (GSEs). Each GSE will be granted 75,000 BANK as an initial allocation in Season 3 (375K total). At the end of the Season, when deliverables are presented to the DAO, the DAO will vote on whether to apply a bonus of up to 750,000 BANK.\n* 500,000 BANK set aside for each problem space to incentivize participation in working groups, led by the five elected members (1M total). This would be allocated to the working group and distributed as per the group\u2019s decision, *not* at the GSE\u2019s discretion.\n\n# BACKGROUND\n\nWhen building an organization, there\u2019s this mental model of working *in* the organization vs working *on* the organization. I highlighted this distinction in [Onwards to Season 3!](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/t\/onwards-to-season-3\/2354#season-3-revenge-of-moloch-8) under the `Season 3: Revenge of Moloch` heading, so I\u2019ll just quickly summarize here:\n\nAs organizations grow and scale, their underlying operational model must change too. As new organizational behavior and information arise, systems must adapt and modify. Our current operational model - grants, guilds, projects, proposals, compensation - was largely ideated between May 4th and June 8th.\n\nSix months in, we\u2019re seeing where the existing operational model is insufficient:\n\n* In Season 2, the Grants Committee ran out of funding with a month left in the Season, despite increasing the budget by an additional 40% from Season 1\n* Projects have come back for funding without a clear way to evaluate whether these projects should be funded a second or third time.\n* Community voting does not reflect critical evaluation. We largely vote yes without taking the time to evaluate the full scope of a proposal.\n* (Related to above) People do not have the bandwidth to participate in proposal discussion\n* Grants Committee sometimes does not have sufficient subject matter expertise to evaluate project scope (namely developer projects)\n* We have no way to evaluate the value that a project brings do the DAO when coming back for funding\n* Compensation was set at 1000 BANK\/hr, back when BANK average 5 cents per token. Today, we sit at 15.\n* Compensation varies heavily in the DAO between standard roles like Talent Scout, Guild Coordinator, Secretary, etc.\n* L2 contributor status doesn\u2019t accommodate for Guest Pass members that have shown themselves worthy of L2 status.\n\nThe points above reflect challenges that come from outgrowing our current framework.\n\nI see the problems broken down into two main categories:\n * **Contributor Alignment** - How do we properly reward active DAO contributors, accounting for the varying skillsets and time commitment people are making?\n* **Strategic Prioritization** - What should we say no to? How do we, as a DAO, learn how to say no?  How do we do this in a way that empowers the community to make decisions while also letting high-context individuals influence outcomes?  \n\nMy point here is that, in Season 0, we directed our attention in working *on* the organization and building systems\/processes. In Season 1 and Season 2, all those same people worked *in* the organization. Now, we have new information and behavior that are forcing us to re-evaluate those systems\/processes that we built.\n\nNow you may stop and say, \u201cWell okay, why don\u2019t we just spin up a working group in this\u2026? Let\u2019s just find a bunch of people interested in solving these problems and let\u2019s get on with it!\u201d Good question! **I tried.** Nearly 3 months ago, I created this forum post: [ALL HANDS ON DECK: Compensation and PLM Working Groups ](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/t\/all-hands-on-deck-compensation-and-plm-working-groups\/1932). In it, I called for a group of interested parties to help scope out our inadequate compensation guidance. The result? Despite having 15 people [signal their interest ](https:\/\/lettucemeet.com\/l\/BENKv), we only met [three times](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/bankless\/Projects-9e37997f29fa4df2b8b4e4284709403a) and we delivered on this flimsy [forum post ](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/t\/compensation-at-banklessdao\/2272).\n\nI see this failure resulting from two factors:\n\n1. Our working group did not have explicit signaling from the DAO that this was a major priority. We\u2019re all fucking busy in our respective niches. Without an explicit mandate from the DAO saying \u201cThis is important, we need people on this project,\u201d it\u2019s really difficult to activate people to redirect their resources and attention on this matter.\n2. I did not have the time and bandwidth to lead this working group. I was active in a number of different places in the DAO, and without some social signal and explicitly incentivization, it eventually fell down my priority list.\n\nGiven my experience here, I want to propose a new model - One that creates an explicit mandate from the DAO to focus on these two problem areas and properly incentivizes participation.\n\nLadies, Gentlemen, and non-binaries, I\u2019d like to introduce the *Governance Solutions Engineer Program*\n\n# MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\nI\u2019m going to be lazy here, but in the [Onwards to Season 3!](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/t\/onwards-to-season-3\/2354#season-3-revenge-of-moloch-8) forum post, I did a quick temp check on this topic with overwhelming support of a focus on Governance and Coordination.\n# SPECIFICATION\n\n## What are GSEs?\n\nIn the failures section just above, I pointed out how I did not have the bandwidth to coordinate\/lead the Compensation working group. As such, the working group ended up falling to the wayside on my list of priorities.\n\nGiven this outcome, I think it\u2019s important to explicitly assign coordinator responsibility. We need people who view it as their #1 priority to *lead* these working groups. As such, I define GSEs as:\n\n* Governance-minded DAO members elected to spec out a comprehensive solution to mission-critical DAO infrastructure challenges.\n* These members are *not* to operate in silos and make decisions on behalf of the DAO. They are to work *with* the DAO to find the optimal solution by progressively designing solutions, presenting them to the DAO, capturing feedback, and iterating.\n* GSEs have appropriate context for the problems they are working on and properly embody the values of the DAO. They are *trusted by their social reputation for acting in the best interest in the DAO.*\n* GSEs *must* make this their #1 priority. Given the scope of activity in the DAO, many qualified members hold multiple other positions. Instead of requiring that GSE only hold one other role, max, any member can apply but must disclose their other responsibilities, both in the DAO and IRL (ie if they have a job). In this way, the DAO can decide if they feel people have the appropriate bandwidth. (The change from 3 to 5 GSEs from Draft1 and the modified comp model allow for some flexibility for GSEs that have additional responsibilities.) Additionally, once elected, members may not accept any additional roles.\n  * For example, if I applied, I would disclose my role as Ops Guild coordinator and part time editor for BanklessHQ.\n  * They may participate in lower order activities. Eg, if I wanted to write a piece of the Newsletter, I can do that. But I cannot accept a role on the newsletter team.\n  * Gov SEs *can* be on the Grants Committee, but must disclose\n\nA successful Gov SE program should result in major clout for Gov SEs in the DAO. At the risk of sounding vain\u2026 what if there were more frogmonkees? Ooh ooh aah aah motherfucker.\n\n## What is the Scope of Work?\n\n> Expected 25-30 hours per week for each GSE. Plan accordingly.\n\nRight now, I think the scope of work should be limited to our most existential threats: (1) Contributor Alignment and (2) Strategic Prioritization. We do have other important challenges that we can expect down the pipeline, but given this is the first time testing a program like this, I would caution against taking on more we can chew without testing this first.\n\n**Deliverables**\n Deliverables would include a detailed specification that we can begin to implement in Season 4. The closest comparable is the original [Season Specification ](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/t\/draft1-banklessdao-season-1-proposal\/904) that still serves as an important guiding document for the DAO to this day.\n\nThis deliverable would have to be in its final form, if not extremely close. The idea is to have something we can implement by the end of Season 3 going into Season 4. As such, community feedback must already be included. I want to acknowledge that this community feedback can take time *but* if `Draft 1` is done properly, much of the community consensus will already be aligned.\n\n**Contributor Alignment**\n* Refining the Guest Pass, L1, and L2 system to be more inclusive\n  * Includes ways to offboard contributors that no longer meet the activity\/recognition threshold\n* Create a compensation framework that can be updated and:\n  * Define [global compensation](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/t\/compensation-at-banklessdao\/2272#compensation-guidelines-4) that standardizes compensation rules for the entire DAO\n  * Provides guidance on letting projects\/guild define [local compensation](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/t\/compensation-at-banklessdao\/2272#compensation-guidelines-4).\n* Envisions a new incentive model that rewards long-term contributors that stick with the DAO for longer periods of time.\n* Work with guilds to standardize guild roles and Coordinape rounds\n* Work with guild Talent Scouts and First Quest to identify challenges and better retain talent entering DAO\n\n**Strategic Prioritization**\n* Model and present various strategic directions the DAO can take (present to DAO for feedback)\n  * Eg. DAO incubator model vs. [software profit model](https:\/\/discord.com\/channels\/834499078434979890\/842810844236742677\/926525644576284804) vs Emergent Strategy\n* Outline a business plan based on an identified strategic model\n* Create an evaluation framework based on the identified strategy to help the DAO make strategic decisions with treasury and grant funding\n* Create a new evaluation *process* that optimizes for both community consensus and responsible decision making (will likely deprecate the Grants Committee as it stands)\n* Design a system that actually measures the output of funded projects and incorporates those findings into the evaluation process\n* Balancing funding cost centers with things that generate revenue or token appreciation\n\n## Gov SEs and Working Groups\n\nEarlier, I said about Gov SEs:\n\n> These members are *not* to operate in silos and make decisions on behalf of the DAO. They are to work *with* the DAO to find the optimal solution by progressively designing solutions, presenting them to the DAO, capturing feedback, and iterating.\n\nOne method of working with the DAO is to create a working group around these two problem spaces. As such, Gov SEs will have to work publicly in these working group. Part of their responsibility will be coordinating these working groups, somewhere between a Guild Coordinator and Project Manager.\n\n## Elections\n[Elections are live.](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/banklessvault.eth\/proposal\/0x33f869377c1b93a3b6db367001b6bb2604626f919ca4322960a20b8f01f58860)\n\n\n\n# FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nMaximum funding for this initiative would be: 2,125,000 BANK and come from the main treasury.

Each deliverable will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5, which will unlock additional compensation.\n  *  Each deliverable will unlock a maximum of 375K BANK, for a total of 750K. \n  * Each rating will unlock 75K in funding. 1 = 75K, 2 = 150K, 3 = 225K, 4 = 300K, 5 = 375K\n  * Additional compensation is *only* for GSEs. Distribution will be up to the 5 GSEs. They can choose to use Team Set Salaries or Coordinape.\n* The two working groups (for each problem space) will have an allocated budget of 500,000 BANK to collectively decide how to allocate and compensate members of the working group. Gov SEs may not draw from this allocation.\n* Funds will be held in a multi-sig held by the 5 GSEs\n  * Once all compensation has been distributed, GSEs must produce a financial report outlining how funds were distributed.\n  * Any funds not distributed will be returned to the treasury\n\n# SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\nDelivery of two detailed specifications by the end of Season 3 that already has community feedback folded into in order to execute and implement during Season 4.\n","protocol":"banklessvault","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xE71eFd5865A42Cb0f23146Dc8E056dBA4E67e9b7","totalVotes":263,"blockNumber":14044376,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/banklessvault.eth\/proposal\/0x749e887debb581c7b416376ffe12d73de3a8a304310479e0c8a2a672ef8785ca","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642707000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643311800}","startTimestamp":1642707000,"endTimestamp":1643311800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Needs revision']","results":"[{'total': 23855154, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 3189938.5, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Helping to build the world\u2019s first decentralized, web3 consultancy has been a thrill. My wife says she has never seen me this motivated to sit in front of a computer screen late into the night.\n\nAs I pivot my career into working in web3 full-time in 2022, I would like to play a bigger role in helping BanklessDAO fulfill its mission as we elevate our work and become an even more impactful community within the web3 ecosystem.\n\n**Qualifications**\n\n* IRL work | 10+ years of nonprofit management experience geared towards helping others reach their full potential.

Right now we have fractionalized liquidity across Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Balancer.\n\nInsufficient liquidity results in poor pricing and volatility. This negatively impacts exchanges looking to offer the best possible pricing for the token, and the individual, hoping to avoid slippage due to the price impact of their trade. Additionally, in the future BanklessDAO interacting with other projects\u2019 tokens require reliable liquidity.\n\nAs BanklessDAO grows we need to continue to address the issue of liquidity.\n\nThrough Tokemak we can solve that problem and deploy liquidity quickly and effectively using the platform.\n\nThe integration of BanklessDAO and Tokemak, would enable the quick and efficient deployment of liquidity, create a token swap opportunity for the DAO to be exposed to the valuation of TOKE, as well as give BANK holders a novel opportunity to single sided stake their bank on the TOKEMAK platform, enabling further liquidity for the BANK token.\n# BACKGROUND\nThe current state of DeFi is comprised of fragmented, unpredictable, and expensively sourced liquidity. Providing 50\/50 paired liquidity is expensive for an individual, and has the looming risk of impermanent loss. Traditional market making solutions are opaque for native DeFi builders, highly centralized, and expensive. Finally, reliance upon whales to provide liquidity results in a perpetual state of uncertainty.\n\nTokemak enables users to both provide liquidity and control where that liquidity goes.\n\nLiquidity Providers deposit single-sided assets into individual Token Reactors and\/or Genesis Pools (ETH, USDC), and earn yield in the form of TOKE, Tokemak\u2019s native protocol token.\n\nLiquidity Directors stake TOKE into individual Token Reactors and vote how that liquidity gets paired from the Genesis Pools and to what exchange venue it gets directed. They too earn yield in the form of TOKE.\n\nTOKE can be thought of as generalized or tokenized liquidity. TOKE holders are able to generate liquidity on demand for whatever tokens they want, on whatever exchange they want, by controlling and directing Tokemak\u2019s TVL. This is done through single sided staking on their platform of the token (BANK) then directing liquidity with TOKE via their front end.\n\nTokemak has several different mechanics and guardrails in place to mitigate IL risk to ensure that Liquidity Providers can always claim their underlying assets deposited, 1:1. These mechanics involve some risk to TOKE stakers, but only as a last resort.\n\nThe protocol captures fees from providing liquidity across DeFi. Over time, this will allow Tokemak to build a strong reserve of various assets in Tokemak\u2019s PCA (Protocol Controlled Assets). In the end, the PCA is controlled by TOKE holders through decentralized governance.\n\nIt offers opportunities for exchanges to reinforce their liquidity and for market makers to leverage the PCA to create deep liquidity for a specific project.\n# MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\nTokemak provides invaluable infrastructure for BanklessDAO as it grows and migrates from L1 to L2\u2019s. The support that the platform would provide for liquidity to the BANK token, would enable the tokens use both internally to the DAO, and externally as other platforms begin to integrate with BanklessDAO.\n\nWith the Tokemak platform managing the liquidity for BanklessDAO, the DAO can focus on onboarding 1 billion people into crypto without having to worry about the liquidity of the token.\n# SPECIFICATION\n* $3,000,000 in notional value, swapped in BANK for TOKE(details below)\n* Kick off a token swap with a 30-day moving average for BANK and TOKE\n# FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\nTo kickstart a Tokemak Reactor, BanklessDAO will need to do a token swap of $3,000,000 in notional value of BANK for TOKE. This will be a backing for the platform to minimize slippage and risk to single sided BANK stakers.\n# SUCCESS METRICS OR KPIS\n* Deep Liquidity in the chosen AMM of BanklessDAO\n* Ability to quickly deploy to different AMM\u2019s, and later L2\u2019s.\n* No or low slippage for trades (buy or sells)\n* Staking opportunity for BanklessDAO members(BANK holders)\n  * Treasuries (DAO, and GUILDS) and BANK holders could stake BANK for TOKE rewards\n* Increased treasury value from token swap (TOKE)\n  * BanklessDAO would gain exposure to the TOKE token value, and if the platform does well and accrues value, the valuation of TOKE would increase.\n# POLL\nExecute swap with Tokemak for BANK reactor ignition - dependent upon C.O.R.E voting results.","protocol":"banklessvault","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xE71eFd5865A42Cb0f23146Dc8E056dBA4E67e9b7","totalVotes":503,"blockNumber":13544840,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/banklessvault.eth\/proposal\/0xabccf8394b35e92043a4055f8430f1babd44fdc763849ad0158441073578a62e","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1635966000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1636574400}","startTimestamp":1635966000,"endTimestamp":1636574400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 23748206, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 272053.9, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 813775.2, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

Protocol-owned-liquidity is the future of liquidity incentive programs. By implementing a bond program for BANK-ETH liquidity, bDAO can distribute its governance tokens to more users while also accumulating its own liquidity.\n\nThe proposed bond program would sell BANK at a discount in exchange for BANK\/ETH LP tokens. The discount rate on bonds is achieved by a novel pricing mechanism that allows the market to set the discount. Basically, bond prices are decreased until a bond is purchased which then pushes up the price of the next bond.\n# BACKGROUND\nOlympus is offering to provide its expertise in bond contract management to support other DAOs interested in owning their own liquidity. This will include providing the UI for bonds and maintaining bond control variables to balance emissions with liquidity accumulation. In exchange for the implementation and community engagement, Olympus would take a 3.3% on all BANK bonds sold. Olympus will use the BANK earned as backing for the intrinsic value of OHM, which would act as a supply sink for BANK. BANK bonds would be offered with a week-long vesting period, which helps prevent immediate price impact from discounted tokens. This aligns the goals of the protocol with those of bond participants. Typically, higher bond volume is seen when users expect the price of the token to increase during the vesting period.\nhttps:\/\/www.olympusdao.finance\/\nhttps:\/\/docs.olympusdao.finance\/pro\/\n# MISSION & VALUES ALIGNMENT\nOlympus has spent months studying and perfecting its own bonds. Their valuable insight will help bDAO get passive, self-regulating bond programs up and running. Bankless DAO will be featured on Olympus Pro X, a unified marketplace for bonds from a multitude of protocols. The marketplace will become the default destination for DeFi investors looking for discounted exposure to various tokens through this unique mechanism. A presence on this interface will be invaluable in reaching new investors, much like the value of listing on an exchange.\n# SPECIFICATION\n\n\u201cThe goal should always be to bootstrap and accrue long-term defensible value, rather than perpetually pay high interest on mercenary capital\u201d \u2014 OlympusDao\n\nMore details: https:\/\/olympusdao.medium.com\/introducing-olympus-pro-d8db3052fca5 \n# FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nAllocate 5M BANK per month to target $3M of liquidity over the next six months.

The Balancer Liquidity Mining Committee plans to match our allocation with 480 BAL\/week over the same time period.\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\nBankless DAO is strongly committed in its educational purposes and considers Balancer one of the most innovative and reliable DeFi protocols. Some members of the Bankless DAO outbound-grant squad therefore decided to apply for a[ Balancer grant](https:\/\/balancer.community\/balancer-community-grants).\n\nBalancer has approved a[ grant proposal](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1K7OQFeZoJZdYjXnVMA0uhjcjcSifjGiZKi5SdQbwTr8\/edit) presented by[ @eagle](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/u\/eagle) and[ @grendel](https:\/\/forum.bankless.community\/u\/grendel) for up to 10k USD to be paid in BAL + some incentives for a liquidity mining program. We've completed the initial grant and are now prepared for the incentives for the LM program.\n\nGenerally speaking, this program should aid in our liquidity issue while providing a token economic boost for the community.

They are not in the ideation phase with loose expectations.\"\n\nAs requiring the projects to have been funded by the Grants Committee previously, and defer funding of the projects that haven\u2019t previously been funded till after Season 2 commencement, as well paying from the Grants Committee fund.\n\nThis put the project funding request at 3,689,000 BANK, which left 1,311,000 BANK in the budget.\n\nIn order to account for the additional funding request needs, the Grants Committee would like the approval of the DAO to roll the 1,521,000 BANK not used in the Project Fund into the Grants Committee Fund, to be validated via snapshot and disbursed from the BanklessDAO Multisig.\nThis funding will go towards funding the deferred guild and projects, and towards project needs of Season 2.\n\nSpecification:\n-Increase the BANK allocation to the GC multisig for season 2 by 1,311,000 resulting in a new total allocation of 11,811,000 BANK\n-Project funding 3,689,000 BANK\n          -First quest: 0x53105aD20960A842e082c60ef243C8c3C49bf518\n461,000 BANK\n           -Bankless Academy: 0xf80Cd14ec747b2AdF7B1A9911b38c65a885dAeeA \n1,340,000 BANK \n           -Bankless Loans Grant Proposal S2: 0x4Aad6d8D45ba9a906B3DbcD9ee6F4d42e8D4a6B1\n194,000 BANK\n            -Website S2: 0xca22f929Aa5DBe2db2d0305d31604FE0dfD386b5\n360,000 BANK\n          -DEGEN: 0x735FF6F197B0dc18eBEE127DD918d2111Eaf8220\n1,334,000 BANK\n-Guild Funding 4,954,403 BANK\n           -Legal 0x984eC14dc726B75cA3eb6A94C64D165D37EA823e\n288,000 BANK\n          -Writers 0xe7636c7ef670a3Bcf772D9d57244c9e88aD90437\n302,000 BANK\n          -Marketing 0xE5a64FC0d3396D11EB63d728791577E254Ac18Ca\n306,000 BANK\n          -Operations 0x47F238eF7F6B9e4f8452d77228B101f7c0419733\n520,000 BANK +3 ETH\n          -Treasury 0x31016FFCEBFf16C20E74A8610f1650DCB5c01Df3\n286,385 BANK\n          -BizDev 0xb40f4ce59dA4A0B6D10aE605E10FD4E6ca9Ed4Ae\n276,000 BANK\n          -Translators 0x045a805c83c1D4C9E5a0bdcC5a27EFa73D2a3c0b\n434,000 BANK\n          -Education 0xcF8422021b408B32983B525778CE45420715f094\n735,000 BANK\n          -AV 0xE2D721c126150BeEE3C56A1AD71A2E0E29A411F0\n606,233 BANK\n          -Analytics 0x28861eeec6ab073A36Cc299ef8186978893e21FF\n592,400 BANK\n          -Design 0x8a771e2874B1e8a38cb08eBCB6e1058d27Fa64c0\n490,000 BANK\n          -Research 0x2b00Fdf9AadAFEe22Cf56eb59BA367f6aCD0ce10\n118,385 BANK\n\nDev Guild Deferred","protocol":"banklessvault","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x23dB246031fd6F4e81B0814E9C1DC0901a18Da2D","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13367661,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/banklessvault.eth\/proposal\/QmbKLqAFKXaDtdzVdTJGVFdReoBQ6vGSPu9MenX5MYVjMM","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1633669200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1634274000}","startTimestamp":1633669200,"endTimestamp":1634274000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Approve', 'Deny']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

However, the Grant Committee members are still not compensated for their input. This proposal seeks to change this, so the GC members are in line with other contributors in the DAO.\n\n# MOTIVATION\nThe members of the Grants Committee carry out their role with extreme respect for the decisions made by the members of the DAO and with a sense of responsibility towards the consequences that the decisions taken may have on the whole DAO both in the immediate present and in the future.\n\nThe role therefore includes different types of commitment:\n* Study of the projects\n* Evaluation of the pros and cons that the rest of the DAO can indicate\n* Decision on the submitted proposals\n\nThe Grants Committee has then the important task of distributing funds to projects that will have a positive impact in the overall performance of the DAO. It is for this reason that the members of this committee are kept engaged, committed and appropriately compensated to perform their tasks.\n\n# SPECIFICATION\nThe Grants Committee is looking for a compensation of 800,000 BANK for Season 1 and Season 2. This is 400,000 BANK per season and it is calculated as per the table below:\n* Grants Committee Review (5 members) at 50,000 BANK = 250,000 BANK\n* Grants Committee Leads (2 members) at 75,000 BANK = 150,000 BANK\n* Total BANK = 800,000 BANK\n\n### Payments\nPayment will be distributed at the end of each season in lump sum.\n\n# CONCLUSION\nDuring the current Season 1 it was decided to assign a certain amount of BANK tokens to members who covered a role in the guilds or in some projects, while failing to define the same for the Grant Committee. This compensation proposal for the members of the Grants Committee aims to resolve the current lack of assimilation of a committee member to a role played in the DAO.","protocol":"banklessvault","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xE71eFd5865A42Cb0f23146Dc8E056dBA4E67e9b7","totalVotes":395,"blockNumber":13355068,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/banklessvault.eth\/proposal\/QmcL7qZ4nA3NoTukMVXXZeramGA8QiqQSpdBFAuRRht5T6","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1633383900}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1633705200}","startTimestamp":1633383900,"endTimestamp":1633705200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Approve', 'Deny']","results":"[{'total': 26827278, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 191555.34, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Curve (aka StableSwap) operates as a constant sum market maker. https:\/\/www.curve.fi\/stableswap-paper.pdf\n\nFor a basket of assets operating at close to equilibrium (e.g. a basket of stablecoins):\n(a) When the token prices are closed to equilibrium (1 to 1), it\u2019s performing close to a constant sum curve.\n(b) When the token prices are shifted away from the equilibrium, it\u2019s performing close to a constant product curve.\n(c) The further the token prices are shifted away, the more slippage the invariant produces. This ensures that the pool can always provide liquidity even at extreme prices.\n\nRecently, Curve has permitted stableswap pool creation for pools that consists of traditional stables (USDT, USDC, DAI) and algostables.\n\nThe benefits of implementing an algostable+USDT+USDC+DAI stableswap pool on Curve are:\n(1) Expands the audience for Basis Dollar; and\n(2) Generates interest in Basis Dollar from arbitrageurs who can close the gap between the ValueLiquid and stableswap pool.\n\nHence, other projects have also started looking at implementing stableswap pools. https:\/\/medium.com\/basis-cash\/stableswap-pools-and-algorithmic-stablecoins-b21ab5cb555f\n\nMechanism (How will this work?):\n(1) Create the stableswap pool.  The initial peg would be 1 BSD to 1 USDC to 1 DAI to 1 USDT.\n(2) For the initial USDT in the pool, the DAO would swap some of the DAI and USDC into USDT.  For example, the initial pool would consist of 40k BSD, 40k USDC, 40k USDT, 40k DAI.\n(3) The Curve LP token will be stakeable. That Curve LP token can be staked with vesting rewards in the form of BSDS rewards.***\n\n***All BSDS rewards are currently locked into ValueLiquid contracts, therefore, there may need to be a requirement to migrate to a new BSDS token contract.  Alternatively, the rewards that the DAO receives can be distributed to the Curve LP stakers.   For the 1st phase, just implement Step (1) and (2) first.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Expands audience\/users for Basis Dollar with the new stableswap pool.\n2. Generates interest in BSD especially from arbitrageurs.\n3. The fees from transactions on the Curve stableswap pool will accrue to LP token holders. Furthermore, the LP token holders may also receive staking rewards mentioned above.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. May require new BSDS token contract as existing BSDS emissions are locked into the ValueLiquid contracts.\n","protocol":"basisdollar","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xF8E802f5adE72D09a601cebD027d00779f5f8C2B","totalVotes":19,"blockNumber":11704386,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/basisdollar.eth\/proposal\/QmS2R3iHdhWVisr8EUU8kJ4f3PvqTLaed4By56eRjVL7xA","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1611306000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1611576000}","startTimestamp":1611306000,"endTimestamp":1611576000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES: Implement stableswap pool', 'NO: Do not implement s\/swap pool']","results":"[{'total': 5147.4663, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

At $1.05, there is a range between $1.0 and 1.049 when BAC investors (staked in boardroom) do not receive seignorage incentives.\n2.  This also affects bond redemptions as bond holders need to have confidence that it reaches 1.05 before they can redeem their bonds for BAC.\n\nBy lowering the threshold, the protocols targets a more narrow peg closer to $1, which is the project\u2019s ultimate value proposition.\n\nReferences to the contract code:\nWith reference to the contract code at https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xebb54967c52a39c21cbd3a91a4e6c3e175d88630#code\n\nLines:\n982 dollarPriceOne = 10**18;\n983 dollarPriceCeiling = dollarPriceOne.mul(105).div(100);\n\n1135 function redeemBonds(uint256 amount, uint256 targetPrice) external onlyOneBlock checkCondition checkOperator {\n1136 require(amount > 0, \u201cTreasury: cannot redeem bonds with zero amount\u201d);\n1140 require(\n1141 dollarPrice > dollarPriceCeiling,\n\n1170 function allocateSeigniorage() external onlyOneBlock checkCondition checkEpoch checkOperator {\n1178 if (dollarPrice > dollarPriceCeiling) {\n1179 \/\/ Expansion ($BSD Price > 1$): there is some seigniorage to be allocated\n\nBased on existing parameters set out in line 983, the threshold is set at $1.05 for both bond redemption and seignorage expansion.\n\nMechanism (how it works):\n\nPropose to amend threshold to $1.01 for both bond redemption and seignorage expansion.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Positive impact for bond holders: Lower threshold for bond holders to redeem bonds. Less trapped cash. Otherwise have to wait till >1.05.\n2. Positive impact for BSDS holders: Lower threshold to start receiving BSD rewards. Otherwise have to wait till >1.05.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. While \u201clowering the threshold is a must for any trustworthy algo-based stablecoin\u201d (in BAC dev\u2019s words), the risk of lowering the threshold has been discussed elsewhere i.e. seignorage and bond redemptions trigger expansion of BSD circulating supply and the usual risks of BSD being sold into DAI and USDC. The long-run use case of BSD e.g. as a yield farming asset, is important to develop also.","protocol":"basisdollar","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xF8E802f5adE72D09a601cebD027d00779f5f8C2B","totalVotes":13,"blockNumber":11665545,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/basisdollar.eth\/proposal\/QmWLKWrNAb8tD9qoqzVFDwhFgiVbRTgTtVffLYEPEfgzr8","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1610787600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1611014400}","startTimestamp":1610787600,"endTimestamp":1611014400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES: Amend threshold to 1.01', 'NO: Keep existing system as-is']","results":"[{'total': 6500.4614, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 78.29539, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Reduces inflation during an epoch where BSD > $1.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1. The APY on Seignorage Shares will decline as BSD inflation will be reduced. However, this may lead to normalized, sustainable long-term APY, rather than short-term capital that moves in and out.\n\n2. Due to the reduction in BSD emission when BSD > $1, there will also be less BSD available for bonds to be redeemed (ensuring that all bondholders will tend to be come long-term bondholders rather than short-term bondholders). It will take more time to clear system debt. However, this will also mean that we will be less likely to fall below the $1 peg and therefore have smaller amounts of system debt.","protocol":"basisdollar","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xF8E802f5adE72D09a601cebD027d00779f5f8C2B","totalVotes":29,"blockNumber":11643000,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/basisdollar.eth\/proposal\/QmSe2au1Ji35n8pMULghV1zrE6uZx4fNwQp5yeZUeDtER5","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1610496000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1610798400}","startTimestamp":1610496000,"endTimestamp":1610798400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES: Cap BSD Inflation \/ Epoch.', 'NO: Keep parameters as-is.']","results":"[{'total': 5938.2397, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

I would like to give you a little more insight into my background.  I have a BBA from the University of Michigan's School of Business with a concentration in Finance and Marketing.  I started out my career as a cost analyst and quickly moved up to a Senior Financial Analyst.  Many of my thoughts came from spending thousands of hours developing budget forecasts or analyzing financial reports.  After my financial career, I moved into sales and marketing for large companies like United Technologies and Saturn Electronics where I reached the level of Director. I have run my own consulting business for over 20 years, I have been a part of 8 startups, and 7 cryptocurrency projects, 3 were successful and 4 were not.  It is the lessons that I take from those failures to ensure that those same mistakes are not repeated with other projects.

The only way to withdraw those XIO tokens is to permanently burn the Cryptonaut. In theory, most people will not want to burn their Tier1 or Tier2 Cryptonaut due to exclusivity, which is another reason these Tiers have a higher multiplier, incentivizing lock ups of tokens that are more likely to never be unlocked.\n\nIf this proposal passes, this multiplier would retroactively apply to the date any Cryptonaut has been purchased (Tier 1 and 2) or minted (Tier 3) prior to this proposal passing. This means Tier 1 and 2 Cryptonauts would only start earning once purchased. This also means Tier 3 Cryptonauts will start earning as soon as they are minted.\n\n\nHow this would impact the existing XIO that comes preloaded in the vaults of all Cryptonauts\n- 1000x Tier3s each have 2,500 XIO, @ 1.05x multiplier, would give each 2,625 weight\n- 100x Tier2s each have 25,000 XIO, @ 1.10x multiplier, would give each 27,500 weight\n- 10x Tier1s each have 250,000 XIO, @ 1.20x multiplier, would give each 300,000 weight\n\nDilution of XIO holders vs Cryptonaut Vault XIO holders multipliers:\n- Because all Cryptonauts come preloaded with XIO in their vaults, if all 10x Tier1, 100x Tier2, and 1000x Tier3 Cryptonauts were purchased and minted as of today (they won\u2019t be, this is an extreme example), and using today\u2019s XIO supply and total XIO in the XLP, the dilution impact this would have is approximately 1.2% towards all FlashV3 tokens earned in November, and 1.3% dilution towards all KIND tokens earned over the next year.  \n- For every additional 1million XIO tokens that are deposited into Tier1s vaults with a x1.2 multiplier, as a worst case scenario of possible dilution, this would cause an increase of dilution by approximately another 0.5%, so 10m XIO deposited would be another 5% dilution.\n- For more details about dilution math, please see this publicly available sheet: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1mxSwY6duEKWykUZI_olSdBe_XCRmhSylpMwtsSmqsbA\/edit#gid=0\n\n\nTo discuss further with community, or if you have any questions, please visit the Blockzero discord channel #proposals https:\/\/discord.gg\/6YWcxpbVUU\n","protocol":"blockzerolabs","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x11231f7Dc863F36A6516Eb4EF052f195000e0000","totalVotes":37,"blockNumber":13643429,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/blockzerolabs.eth\/proposal\/0x411b52207afe43817f13049f0dfd598f660b07b8caeeaaf3d108e6bfe7cc637f","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637280000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637884800}","startTimestamp":1637280000,"endTimestamp":1637884800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No', 'I abstain']","results":"[{'total': 1547401, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 5090930.5, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

(see additional info below)","content":"Additional Information:\n\nYou can discuss here: https:\/\/discord.gg\/vECzp2kc \n\nAfter speaking with our senior blockchain engineer I have determined that the best course of action for the AquaFi protocol in regards to layer 2 support is as follows. \n\nIn order to support sidechains\/L2, we need a L1-L2 token bridge. Due to the nature of the Aqua token (has mining ability), the token bridge must be able to mint and burn tokens at will. \n\nFor example, if you transfer 1000 Aqua to the L1 side of the bridge from L2, 1000 Aqua must be minted on L1\/mainnet. This means tokens can be exchanged 1:1 between the Ethereum mainnet and the sidechain\/L2 thus keeping the price of the Aqua token consistent over all chains where AquaFi is deployed. Unfortunately due to the permissionless nature of AquaFi (as it currently stands) it would be impossible to update the minters for the Aqua token. \n\nI propose:\n1) we allow the Blockzero council to update (add or remove) the minters for the Aqua token via the council controlled multi-sig wallet.\n2) we implement a time-lock (duration to be determined) which means anytime the council wants to update the minter addresses, the council will need to submit a transaction to the ethereum network which will be publicly viewable. The council must then wait a period of time (duration to be determined) before the change is live and the minter addresses are then updated. \n3) we implement functionality that allows the council to permanently revoke this permission when executed\n\nIf we decide not to add this functionality, there is a very high chance that we will require a token migration each time we want to add or remove a new sidechain\/L2 network. The alternatives are:\n1) Do not launch with sidechain\/L2 support and require a rather large migration down the line if we want to support in the future\n2) Launch with support for predetermined sidechains\/L2 networks - eg Arbitrum - this can never be updated (permissionless)\n3) Launch AquaFi independently onto sidechains\/L2 - this effectively means Aqua on the other networks are completely independent from Aqua on the ethereum mainnet - so different prices, different tokens\n","protocol":"blockzerolabs","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x11231f7Dc863F36A6516Eb4EF052f195000e0000","totalVotes":34,"blockNumber":12652991,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/blockzerolabs.eth\/proposal\/QmZGddNkbmfymwTfuqdWmHpd3Zed8UEVoMTijwCEfiTf9A","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1623945600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1624377600}","startTimestamp":1623945600,"endTimestamp":1624377600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No', 'I abstain']","results":"[{'total': 2647342, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 270193.22, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 187.0504, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

The value of the bounty increases with the success of the token and project. In addition, NFT artists will create numerous unique NFTs that will be minted specially for hackers and auditors that will responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.\n\nWe offer every participant in the Ethereum ecosystem skin in the game to ensure a more secure future for the users of #Ethereum.\n\nThis proposal aims to incentivize hackers, auditors, and the community to protect the B.protocol contracts by promoting responsible disclosure.\n\nThe proposal suggests depositing BPRO tokens into B.protocol proactive vault on Hats. BPRO vault is a permissionless vault where anyone can participate by depositing and withdrawing. $BPRO.\n\n## Motivation\n\n* 24\/7 audit on your protocol with a proactive approach that incentivizes the hacker to disclose the vulnerability instead of exploiting it.\n* A disclosed vulnerability means no TVL\/ TOKEN and, most of all, no reputation loss.\n* PR of disclosure and fix becomes a strength to the project and its development team.\n* Attract more users to the \u201cstrong and secure protocol.\u201d\n* Permissionless vault - token holders and the B.protocol community can deposit or withdraw in the same permissionless nature.\n\n**BPRO value:**\n\n* BPRO staked in Hats vault increases B.protocol security guarantees\n* Staking BPRO in the hat vaults reduces circulating token supply\n* One-sided yield farming based on your BPRO\n* Participating in Hats pull at this initial phase will be rewarded with extra allocation points (Extra token incentive for the first 20 projects to join). This way, the B.protocol community will have extra voting power in what can potentially become an important security layer of the ecosystem.\n\n**B.protocol community \/ BPRO holders:**\n\n* Join the effort to secure the ecosystem.\n* Financial incentive in the form of Yield farming (Protocol protection mining)\n* Protect their own project token by risking a portion of their holdings. By doing that, get $HAT and become influential in the Hats governance process.\nHats liquidity mining program will start soon.\n\n## Specification\nThe hats protocol is permissionless, meaning anyone can participate and lock BPRO in the Hats BPRO vault. The BPRO vault protects the B.protocol contracts from hacks by incentivizing responsible disclosure through the Hats protocol.\n\nIf a hacker responsibly discloses an exploit through the Hats mechanism, a portion (depending on severity) of the locked BPRO tokens will go to the hacker as a reward, some vested, and some immediately. ( See the reward split in Kleros vault, for example)\n\nThis is a win-win situation for Hackers, the B.protocol community, and the core team.\n\nAs a BPRO holder: Statistically, when a protocol suffers a hack or exploit, its token value will drop between 35-50% at the 24 hours following the hack (Messari). It is rational to lock part of a user\u2019s holdings to protect the rest of her holdings from a potential hack.\n\nHacker gets a substantial amount of FUNGIBLE money, become known for disclosing a critical vulnerability instead of rekt\u2019ing the protocol and its stakeholders, and receive funds without becoming a worldwide criminal.\n\nWe found out that a crucial element for black hat hackers is privacy, permissionless, no KYC.\n\nThe decentralization of the protocol is critical in order to incentivize anyone involved in the protocols to protect it: community, artist, investors, team members, & developers.\n\n## Rationale\nSecurity underlies the technology of smart contracts; there isn\u2019t such a thing as too much security. We think Ethereum dapps should include both our solution and others.\n\nThe beauty of Hats being a fully permissionless protocol is that DAOs, treasuries, and individuals can deposit or withdraw funds from the vault at any point. Utilize Idle funds for active protection with full depositor control for treasuries and users alike.\n\nThe Hats contracts are public (find the link at the first comment) verified on Etherscan and can be found by clicking the \u201cView Contracts Covered\u201d under Hats vault in hats dApp (find the link at the first comment)\n\n## Audit and safety measures:\n\n* Audit reports - find the link at the first comment.\n* Hats is live with Hats vault containing more than $130K USDC worth of tokens to further incentivize responsible disclosure.\n\n## Vault fund:\n\nAs a community, you can take mutual action to incentivize others to make B.protocol a safer environment.\n\nBear in mind that funds will be released from the vault only due to vulnerability disclosure. The upside from fixing issues is drastically more valuable than the financial face value of the BPRO tokens that are going to be deposited.\n\nIt\u2019s in the hands of the B.protocol community to determine changes to this initial deposit and to increase\/ decrease its size in relation to changes you are doing in the contracts.\n\n## Implementation\n\n* Fund $BPRO vault on hats\n\n## Proposal:\n\nB.protocol DAO will deposit a 100k$ worth in BPRO to incentivize White hats hackers and auditors to make B.protocol a safer environment.\n\nAs a reference, Kleros and Liquity already decided to deposit 200k$ and 250k$ worth of tokens in hats vault.","protocol":"bprotocol","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xa9d062B23650C9191673d9496d9e700d37DC55f5","totalVotes":28,"blockNumber":13373033,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bpro.eth\/proposal\/Qma56pGKhv3BkTDGWLoqtNL7KS9optbPyzBoyhtrV7EMKG","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1633626000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1634058000}","startTimestamp":1633626000,"endTimestamp":1634058000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - BIP #7', 'NO - BIP #7']","results":"[{'total': 261368.34, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Incentivising New Users\n\nNew B.Protocol users includes any users who join during LM phase 2 (as described above) through any of these integrations:\n\n* Current Maker and Compound integrations.\n* New Liquity<>B.Protocol integration (from any UI, including Pickle and other UIs that might be added).\n* Instadapp<>B.Protocol and\/or other integrations that might be added during this LM phase.\n\nIt is proposed that a one-time reward of 50 BPRO will be given to new users who Import their accounts or open new ones on B.Protocol.\n\nIn order to prevent sybil attacks, eligible accounts for this reward must have a minimum of $10k worth of assets in deposits, for a minimum period of 30 days. The reward is limited to the first 300 unique addresses. \u200b\u200bAll rewards will be distributed 30 days after the end of the 90-days period to enable also last minute users to get the rewards they are entitled to.\n\n## 2. KPI-based Liquidity Mining for users\n \nIt is proposed that [UMA\u2019s KPI Options](https:\/\/umaproject.org\/kpi-options.html) will be used for the KPI based LM.\n\nFor that, 90k BPRO from the DAO Reservoir account will be deposited as collateral to mint 90k BPRO UMA Option tokens (ERC20), that will be distributed to Users according to the same conditions as the previous LM. A floor price of 33% will be set and the options will mature at the end of the 2nd LM phase, at block number 13487135. If the TVL of B.Protocol will reach or exceeds $150m, the options will mature to 100% (1 BPRO per option). If the TVL fails to reach $150m the option will mature at the floor price (0.33 BPRO per option), and the remaining 60k BPRO will be returned to the DAO Reservoir account.\n\n## 3. Providing One-Sided BPRO Liquidity on Uniswap v3\n\nHaving liquidity of BPRO for new members who would like to join and participate in the governance of B.Protocol is important for the health of the protocol. Still, it seems the LPs rewards in the first LM didn\u2019t achieve the goal of growing the number of participants.\n\nIt is suggested that the B.Protocol DAO will deposit 100k BPRO tokens from its reservoir into a Uniswap V3 BPRO\/ETH pool, as a new mechanism to provide liquidity for new small to medium members. The 100k BPROs will be concentrated between the range of $2-$5, according to the current ETH value at the day of the execution. .\n\nThis way the DAO can guarantee liquidity for new members who wish to join the governance.\n\n## 4. Growth Squad Fund\n\nPutting direct efforts in the growth, promotion and marketing of the protocol was raised by a few members on the forum and Discord. It was [proposed](https:\/\/forum.bprotocol.org\/t\/b-protocol-growth-squad-fund-proposal-draft\/115\/9) that a new community based \u201cGrowth Squad\u201d will be formed to pursue this goal.\n\nThis proposal suggests, in accordance with previous discussions, that a Growth Squad Fund will be funded by the DAO with 25k BPRO to be utilized towards certain growth KPIs were suggested in this thread [link](https:\/\/forum.bprotocol.org\/t\/b-protocol-growth-squad-fund-proposal-draft\/115\/9?u=a7om).\n\n## 5. Backing B.Protocol-Immunefi Bug Bounty Program\n\nMany users in DeFi consider the security of the protocols they are using as the leading measurement for their involvement. Last week, Immunefi launched a new Bounty Program for B.Protocol, with up to 50k BPRO bounties.\n\nThis proposal suggests that the DAO will dedicate a special vault with 50k BPRO to be used by the multisig if and only if payouts are needed to be made to bug hunters of the Immunefi program.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests 5 sections to be voted by the DAO to dedicate funds from its Reserve:\n\n1. 15,000 BPRO - for up to 300 new users, 50 BPRO each, rewarding new or imported accounts.\n2. 90,000 BPRO - using [UMA\u2019s KPI Options](https:\/\/umaproject.org\/kpi-options.html)\n3. 100,000 BPRO - to be deposited from the DAO Reservoir to Uniswap BPRO-ETH v3 pool to provide liquidity to new governance members to join.\n4. 25,000 BPRO - to fund the B.Protocol Growth Squad Fund.\n5. 50,000 BPRO - to be deposited in a dedicated vault to be used for payouts to Immunefi Bug Hunters only if and when a bug is found.","protocol":"bprotocol","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xa9d062B23650C9191673d9496d9e700d37DC55f5","totalVotes":26,"blockNumber":12923584,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bpro.eth\/proposal\/QmcMCm17DZJMB42g7aShm7JUTkiQFvuybfJgsRiiN1f1fK","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1627601400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1628033400}","startTimestamp":1627601400,"endTimestamp":1628033400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For BIP-2', 'Against BIP-2']","results":"[{'total': 186604.88, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 28172.92, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

As a result, the main goal of the liquidity mining program that was voted by the DAO, is not met - new users are joining in very low numbers as the BPRO rewards can\u2019t be utilized due to the low liquidity.\n\nIn addition, new players who would like to participate in the protocol governance, can\u2019t purchase tokens on the market due to this very low liquidity.\n\nAs the current Liquidity Mining Program runs for exactly a month now, this proposal main goal is to re-adjust the rewards on BPRO in a way that will be better aligned with all stakeholders of the protocol (Users and Token Holders alike) in order to bring new traction both to the protocol and to the token itself as they now go hand in hand.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\nIncentivizing Sushiswap and Uniswap V2 BPRO-ETH liquidity providers with BPRO will increase liquidity for the BPRO-ETH pair and enable new (and existing) players to buy BPRO tokens.\n\n### Rationale\n**DEX choice:** Though initially, and over Discord, the discussion was around Sushiswap only, Uniswap is still the most popular DEX and holds the current liquidity of BPRO. So though Sushiswap may have some incentive mechanisms that are missing in Uniswap, this proposal suggests rewarding LPs on both DEXes at this stage.\n\n**Rewards:**The current Liquidity Mining Program distributes every block roughly 0.14 BPRO to the users of B.Protocol. This proposal suggests to re-adjust this distribution in a way that 50% (0.07 BPRO) will be distributed as rewards to SLP holders of the BPRO-ETH Sushiswap and Uniswap V2 pools. The remaining 50% (0.07 BPRO) will be distributed to B.Protocol users in each block under the same conditions of the current Liquidity Mining Program.\n\n**Duration:** This new Sushiswap\/Uniswap BPRO-ETH SLP\/LP holders rewards will become part of the current Liquidity Mining Program and will end at the same time as it was voted upon initially by the DAO by the end of July 2021 at block 14085231.\n\n### Technical Specification\nAt every block the ETH-BPRO SLP holders on Sushi, and LP holders on Uniswap will be recorded. Further at every block it will be recorded upon how many BPRO tokens each user controls (i.e., eligible to withdraw from Sushi\/Uniswap).\n\nA total amount of 0.07 BPRO will be accrued, in every block, to the entire holders, proportional to their BPRO holdings at Uniswap and Sushi.\n\nThe accumulated BPRO will be distributed to the users once the current program ends (at block 14085231).","protocol":"bprotocol","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x1107b8ed3A132a601716989FD84fD66ed1122C72","totalVotes":58,"blockNumber":12498691,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bpro.eth\/proposal\/QmR1rTEAnmT4CwYvC3MpkBsddLuWc5v5fUvwKEgUW6gwVM","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1621881900}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1622347140}","startTimestamp":1621881900,"endTimestamp":1622347140,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For BIP-1', 'Against BIP-1']","results":"[{'total': 384842.44, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 7974.6655, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This is to confirm the dissolution of the Committee and to reallocate the funds to other initiatives. After discussion in the governance forum (https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/dissolve-investment-committee-tropofarmer-and-gfunk\/654) the following conclusions are proposed:\n1. Dissolve the Investment Committee\n2. Put the NFTs currently in the Investment Committee wallet under the jurisdiction of the NFT Flipping Committee\n3. Re-allocate the remaining funds according to the following specification:\n- Marketing Committee: 20%\n- DeFi Investments: 13.33%\n- NFT Flipping Committee: 26.67%\n- Metaverse Committee: 33.33%\n- Crypto Committee: 6.67%\n\n**Specification \u200c Overview \u200c**\nIt has been a few months since we passed BIP-003 with an original intention to simplify the honeypot allocations in an investment strategy, allowing:\n\n30% Metaverse Committee\n20% Investment Committee\n10% Community NFT Fund\n20% Defi\n20% Spending Reserve\n\nCurrently there is approximately 15.5 eth remaining in the Investment Committee Wallet as well as 8 NFTs (https:\/\/zapper.fi\/account\/0x3b762b6a03b5a0772c2d64e1d05e5b77d841c0b4)\n\nThe three previous proposals to dissolve the Investment Committee are listed here:\nVote to Disband The Investment Committee (https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/vote-to-disband-the-investment-comitte\/577\/4)\nDissolve IC and Create Automated Crypto Trading Investment with Unlisted.io (https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/dissolve-ic-and-create-automated-crypto-trading-investment-with-unlisted-io\/644)\nVary Investment Strategy - dissolve investment committee and fund crypto committee (https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/vary-investment-strategy-dissolve-investment-committee-and-fund-crypto-committee\/607\/6)\n\nThe following are the results of the voting from the governance forum:\n\nShould we disband the Investment Committee:\n95% - Yes\n5% - No\n\nWhat should we do with the NFTs that are currently in the Investment Committee wallet?\n67% - Hodl the NFTs and put them under the jurisdiction of the NFT Flipping Committee\n33% - Keep NFTs in current wallet and categorize them as \u201cLong Term Hodls\u201d\n0% - Liquidate and start anew\n\nWhat should we do with the funds that are currently in the Investment Committee wallet?\nThere is currently approximately 15.5 eth remaining in the IC wallet. The options for reallocation include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n32% - Split between multiple committees (please specify in comments)\n21% - Send to DeFi allocation\n21% - Send to Marketing Committee\n16% - Send to NFT Flipping Committee\n10% - Send to Metaverse Committee\n\nSince the split was the choice with the highest votes, it is proposed to split the funds among multiple committees. Due to the complexity of this answer, the sentiments were taken from the comments that were expressed in the forum. Those were counted and the proposed re-allocation is based on the percentage of votes each committee recieved in the comments section only.\n\n**Rationale** \u200c\nThe reasons for this proposal are:\n- Continued questioning of Investment Committee\u2019s effectiveness\n- Adjust previous strategy that is not creating expected output\n\n**Technical Specification** \u200c\n- Confirm vote to dissolve Investment Committee via Snapshot vote.\n- Use governance forum to re-allocate remaining funds\n\n**Test Cases** \u200c\nBears have proven that they can manage investment strategies better than these external parties, especially with vested interest i nthe success of the Hideout. There have been net losses from the Investment Committee to date, and calls for more active account management.\n\nCopyright \u200c\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.","protocol":"buzzedbearhideout","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xE6BF0CCa5Eb1e0B45D3a745E1e8868D4171c408F","totalVotes":43,"blockNumber":14036623,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/buzzedbears.eth\/proposal\/0x6028438f80dede39348063cb4bddfbea97f4d5b4e3d31bc9ce5c7e5130190cf4","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642604400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642975200}","startTimestamp":1642604400,"endTimestamp":1642975200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 862, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

As a long term project, BBH DAO should invest in its own success.\n\nFurther, there has been listing below the mint price, and undercutting, causing a drop in the floor. Many bears have requested the BBH DAO buy floor bears to fix the floor.\n\nThis proposal is not suggesting a buyback program to fix the floor, but instead a sustainable long term program, to both reinvest in the Bears, and provide an avenue to enable those wanting quick liquidity to get a guaranteed minimum value. This shall be known as the Bear Fund, as coined by @Jimpson.\n\nThe Bear Fund will be made up of two \u201cparts.\u201d One part will be where floor bears are accumulated, and the other will be a liquidity pool that will hold Ethereum used to purchase bears from those looking to sell. The buyback price of the bears will be calculated based on the equity value of one bear (defined as Total Value of the Honeypot\/9,999).\n\nIt is expected that this process will be able to automated mid Q1 2022 with tech coming out from XMON.\n\nMotivation\n\nProviding liquidity to Bear holders that require it quickly.\nProviding an avenue for the BBH DAO to accumulate good value bears to either sell at a higher price or hold for future\nThere have been multiple proposals prior to this shoing considerable support. Earlier proposals referenced here:\n\nContinuous Buy-Back & Burn Program \n (https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/continuous-buy-back-burn-program\/240)\n\nBear Fund - Proposal (https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/bear-fund-proposal\/599)\n\nUse Treasury to Buy Back Bears Below Mint (https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/use-treasury-to-buy-back-bears-below-mint\/101)\n\nSpecification \u200c Overview \u200c\n\nBuyback Price Calculation:\n\nThere will be a Maximum Buyback Price that will be calculated as 20% below the equity value of one Bear.\n\nThe following is an example of how the repurchase price will be calculated.\n\nIf the current valuation of the honeypot is approximately $1M and there are 9,999 Bears, that means each Bear\u2019s equity value is $1,000,000\/9,999. This comes to approximately $100 per bear or .024eth at a valuation of $4,150\/eth at the time of writing. At a 20% discount of the equity value, that would mean that the Hideout would repurchase Bears for .0192eth.\n\nBy this logic, any Bear purchased under the designated value (i.e. 0.24 Eth) would be purchased at a discount, and thus profitable for the Honeypot. Although this would mean that the seller would take a slight loss, that loss would be equivalent to the convenience of having the ability to immediately liquidate their bear holdings. The strike price will be regularly adjusted to reflect the total value of the honeypot.\n\nListing fees:\n\nListing fees will be paid by the seller. So, in the case of the Hideout purchasing a floor bear, the seller will pay the gas fee. In the case of the Hideout selling a repurchased Bear, the Hideout will pay the listing fee.\n\nLiquidity Pool:\n\nThe Honeypot currently holds 92eth. We can expect that a large portion of this may be eaten up after the initial passing of this proposal. Moving forward, we will be able to have a more accurate forecast for expected redemption of this offer. This will enable a dedicated allocation of ether to be reserved for this mechanism.\n\n*In the extremely unlikely event that all Bears want to liquidate, investment positions will have to be liquidated in order to accommodate all requests. However, with the 20% buyback price discount, 20% of the Honeypot will remain, minus listing fees.\n\nBuyback Mechanism:\n\nIt is proposed to establish the Bear Fund as an automated platform that can be accessed at all times. A mechanism of this kind is expected to be available to the Bears in late January 2022.\n\nSelling DAO-Owned Bears:\n\nThe bears re-purchased by the Hideout could be resold on OpenSea at a 50% premium from the re-purchasing price or the original mint price (.05eth), whichever is larger. This would cover gas costs, offer the Honeypot an economic gain, and raise the floor price of the Bears.\n\nFormula with example can be found here: https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/bear-buy-back-program\/630\n\nBBH DAO-owned Bears:\n\nBears purchased through this arrangement would sit in a DAO owned wallet. These bears would not be eligible for voting thus affecting the voting quorum. This will be adjusted to reflect 8% of the total number of Bears that are held by the public, not including the Bears held by the DAO. (Example: if the DAO owns 200 bears then the amount in circulation will be 9,799. That would mean for a proposal to pass it would require that 800 votes be counted, which is 8% of the outstanding bears.)\n\nQuality Assurance:\n\nIt is proposed that the Honeypot Manager will periodically monitor this process to ensure quality assurance of all processes.\n\nRationale \u200c\n\nBBH DAO should invest in its own success and currently does not have exposure to that success.\nBear holders sometimes require immediate liquidity so this program enables a quick exit for holders should they require.\nTechnical Specification \u200c\n\nA platform is currently under development for release in late January that would enable this proposal to be implemented. Further details of that project will be advised in due course. This proposal should work through governance protocol and get feedback and refinement with the view to commencing upon the project\u2019s launch in late January.\nA liquidity pool must be maintained in order to fill all sell orders.\nHoneypot Manager to periodically assess accuracy and integrity of mechanism.\nTest Cases \u200c\n\nThis is a new proposal initiative, which takes into account the past success of projects like NFTX.io, and also the great feedback received via Jimpson\u2019s governance proposal Bear Fund buy back scheme.\n\nCopyright \u200c\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.","protocol":"buzzedbearhideout","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xE6BF0CCa5Eb1e0B45D3a745E1e8868D4171c408F","totalVotes":67,"blockNumber":13967074,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/buzzedbears.eth\/proposal\/0x228bf46d21983cbf4b1165e39a02ebe0f41b8f2cffaef3e038379ac25e9c7e33","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641675600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642057140}","startTimestamp":1641675600,"endTimestamp":1642057140,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 903, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 6, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Its original intention was that every bear gets a vote (\u201c1 bear = 1 vote\u201d) and that there would be bear locking and distribution from the honeypot to all bear holders.\n\nOf the original intention for Buzzed Bears, neither locking nor distribution has been finalized, albeit there have been questions raised in discord and the governance hideout, to move these aspects forward.\n\nIn respect of the distribution to bears, the general consensus from the community has been that they want to see the honeypot grow before any distribution, so that when distributions commence, they are self sustaining and will not erode the honeypot, thus enabling it to keep growing.\n\nDefiJesus recently held a Q&A with available bears around these two topics, asking what bears would like to do moving forward. There was a question raised as to whether a distribution of profits would trigger SEC legislation from some bears. The general view of those on the call was that Buzzed Bears should get legal advice before distributing to bears, given the large majority of US bear holders, so that it stays within laws to which it is accountable. It is proposed therefore that there be no distribution to bears until legal advice from a proper counsel like Fenwick (who are providing advice to other NFT groups like BAYC) is obtained.\n\nFinally, following the QnA, two proposals have been put up in the hideout around the matter of bear locking. Firstly, a summary of the QnA (Hibernation - Next steps 1) and secondly, a proposal to move forward with the bear locking (Hibernation - locking your bear). There has been considerable feedback provided both formally and informally across discord and the hideout, and it has become clear that whilst the intention of bears is to hibernate, the technology to do so must be sustaining, and the most appropriate course of action is to move Buzzed Bears to locking and layer 2 in one transaction, meaning all future transactions will be with little to no gas fees. However, given there is no market identified leader in layer 2 protocol at this point of time, the most sensible approach is to postpone the locking until such time as this occurs.\n\nThis proposal therefore is :\n\n1. There will be no bear locking at this current time\n2. In future, bear locking will be proposed when a layer 2 protocol is determined suitable to ensure success of the Buzzed Bears brand and provide a path forward where gas is not a prohibitive requirement for bear holders.\n3. Legal advice will be sought regarding distribution to bear holders prior to the establishment of any distribution proposal. A distribution proposal should come back through governance and BIP at a later date. Payment of this advice shall come from the spending reserve and is undetermined at this point in time.\n4. Reduce the quorum of voting in BIP to 8% of the total number of bears, until such time as bear locking is implemented.\n\nMotivation\n\n1. Addressing requests around two key elements of the advertised Buzzed Bears project\n2. Obtaining legal advice to ensure BBH DAO stays within laws to the fullest extent possible to protect those signing transactions on behalf of BBH DAO and also the community in receiving any funding from the honeypot\n3. Listening to concerns raised by community members and provide a pathway forward to address those concerns\n4. Providing a voting structure that supports those bears that are invested in the DAOs success\n\nSpecification \u200c Overview \u200c\n\nBear Locking & Gas\n\n1. No locking to occur at the present time\n2. Proposal for bear locking to be revisited when a suitable layer 2 solution is cemented\n\nThere has been considerable feedback received that the cost of gas is prohibitive for both small and whale holders of Buzzed Bears. Given Buzzed Bears are on the Ethereum network, there is no way around this, while on layer 1. Therefore, there will be no locking implemented at this point in time, as the intention is to benefit bears, not hinder growth. Given the feedback around the price of gas, it has been suggested by many to move to a layer 2 solution. At the moment, there are a number of layer 2 vying for the prime position, and it is unclear the best avenue forward. Therefore, the proposal is to postpone the bear locking until the layer 2 solution is more clear. Then, a proposal will be revisited for locking of bears, and moving to a layer 2 network, in the same transaction. It will be proposed that the honeypot cover the cost of this transaction for bears holders.\n\nHoneypot distribution\n\n1. No distribution until legal advice is obtained and a pathway forward determined\n\nAt this point in time, the majority of bear holders have expressed a desire to continue to grow the honeypot. BBH DAO will seek legal advice on the distribution of honeypot to bear holders, to ensure it is operating within applicable laws. BAYC have recently sought advice from Fenwick lawyers for the implementation of a token system and Buzzed Bears are awaiting a meeting to progress an answer to this distribution question. Buzzed Bears will seek advice on the best method to move forward, and will report back to the community on this once it has been obtained, with a pathway to implementation. By the time the community seeks to distribute, the answers for this legal question should be well known.\n\nModified voting rights\n\n1. Ensuring sufficient quorum for voting by reducing the 10% requirement to 8%\n\nCurrently there are not many bears that participate in voting, and it is a struggle to meet the 10% voting requirement (1000 votes). However, of the proposals presented, they are more often that not voted in one direction close to if not 100% of votes. Therefore, to reduce stress on those active bear members who are voting, it is proposed to reduce the 10% voting requirement to 8%. This will mean that the voting requirement is 800 votes. This will ensure those bears invested and committed are able to progress proposals for the benefit of the DAO with less stress. A review of the voting quorum should occur when bear locking is implemented.\n\nRationale \u200c\n\n1. Implementing bear locking will provide enhanced benefits to bears, but only when it can be done through a mechanism which doesn\u2019t impact bear holders. The layer 2 solution makes sense, but it is sensible to determine the market leader and move in that direction.\n2. We have people working daily on the DAO that live in wildly different countries with different legislations but a majority is concentrated in the US. As community members take up more responsibility they also take on any extra possible liability. So in order to make sure we keep our bears protected and the future of our community protected we must show our willingness to abide by the applicable laws and consult with industry leading law firms like Fenwick.\n3. There is generally a scramble to get voting for proposals even when they pass with 100%. This creates stress on members, and doesn\u2019t help facilitate good DAO outcomes. Reducing the voting quorum will enable proper consideration, and rigour but with less stress. More voting by bear members is welcomed and recommended also.\n\nTechnical Specification \u200c\n\n1. Wait for appointment with Fenwick legal counsel (or suitable alternative) regarding DAO distribution. Payment for this legal advice and appointment to come from the spending reserves bucket of the honeypot.\n2. Continue to review layer 2 solution for the moving of Buzzed Bears for locking.\n\nTest Cases \u200c\n\nThere are many groups that have both locking and tokens\/distribution. Many are doing so without consulting legal advice. BAYC are in the process of obtaining legal advice with the view to implement a token. This will be a test case as they are consulting Fenwick. BBH DAO will seek to get legal advice from this firm to determine the steps forward.\n\nCopyright \u200c\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.","protocol":"buzzedbearhideout","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9F666457E792101523d4dcb4715750c9bce68a02","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13820857,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/buzzedbears.eth\/proposal\/0xcfd2a40369ce35eb25c18d022ff6d1ae9bf1cc3bde31a44f7ba6293ecce93b87","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639720800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1640325600}","startTimestamp":1639720800,"endTimestamp":1640325600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Locking should be postponed', 'Locking should be on L2 Eth', 'Bears should move to L2 Eth', 'Legal advice before royalties', 'Postpone royalties pending legal', 'Reduce voting quorum to 8%']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

This short BIP pulls together the information discussed in those forums. Due to the significant increase in metaverse tokens and metaverse sales following the announcement of metaverse uptake by Facebook, it is important to act without further haste, to avoid bears missing out on further opportunity.\n\nBears have defined the goal \/ purpose for the metaverse through vote, as being a place for both socialisation and monetisation. This means it can be used as both a place to stream AMA\/townhall, gallery for bears, a place to support a launchpad, merch, games and even potential future huts or caves for bears.\n\nOptions have been considered, and the Sandbox has presented as the best option to suit the use proposed. Having a 3x3 will allow our PFP to be displayed on the sandbox map, so we are easier to find, which helps with monetisation.\n\nOther land and MVI tokens should be considered to be purchased as part of the buzzed bear portfolio of metaverse options.\n\nMotivation\n\n1. Crypto is moving very fast, and metaverse tokens have 5x the past two weeks and we don\u2019t want to miss further opportunity\n2. Metaverse will be the future for socialisation and monetisation\n3. There are limited land allotments and once they are all sold, land will become premium for the Sandbox\n4. Sandbox goes live Q1 2022, so we need to be in early before everyone jumps on board, including flippers who are currently keeping prices up in decentraland.\n\nSpecification \u200c Overview \u200c\n\n1. We buy a 3x3 parcel of land in the sandbox (or equivalent blocks which add up to a 3x3 in the same area), either a secondary sale or a partnership option, whichever is most cost effective. At the time of writing, it is the secondary sale option. (price currently estimated between 11-20eth)\n2. We buy land in other metaverses as determined by voting within the metaverse discussion channel in discord. This may include a block within DCL, NFTWorlds, Matrix etc, but may be no further land if that is determined. Votes will go up, and a process will be implemented, following the successful approach of the NFT Flipping Committee.\n3. We approve the Apex Flip Leads to purchase the land (as they are NFTs) through their roles in the NFT Committee\n4. We buy such other metaverse tokens as determined by informal voting within the metaverse discussion discord, and we seek the multisig operators to implement this. This power will transferred to the Crypto Gods leading the Crypto Investment Committee should that BIP (currently in voting) pass.

This short BIP pulls together the information discussed in those forums. Due to the significant increase in metaverse tokens and metaverse sales following the announcement of metaverse uptake by Facebook, it is important to act without further haste, to avoid bears missing out on further opportunity. \n\nBears have defined the goal \/ purpose for the metaverse through vote, as being a place for both socialisation and monetisation. This means it can be used as both a place to stream AMA\/townhall, gallery for bears, a place to support a launchpad, merch, games and even potential future huts or caves for bears. \n\nOptions have been considered, and the Sandbox has presented as the best option to suit the use proposed.  Having a 3x3 will allow our PFP to be displayed on the sandbox map, so we are easier to find, which helps with monetisation. \n\nOther land and MVI tokens should be considered to be purchased as part of the buzzed bear portfolio of metaverse options. \n\nMotivation\n\n1. Crypto is moving very fast, and metaverse tokens have 5x the past two weeks and we don't want to miss further opportunity \n2. Metaverse will be the future for socialisation and monetisation \n3. There are limited land allotments and once they are all sold, land will become premium for the Sandbox\n4. Sandbox goes live Q1 2022, so we need to be in early before everyone jumps on board, including flippers who are currently keeping prices up in decentraland. \n\nSpecification \u200c Overview \u200c\n1. We buy a 3x3 parcel of land in the sandbox (or equivalent blocks which add up to a 3x3 in the same area), either a secondary sale or a partnership option, whichever is most cost effective. At the time of writing, it is the secondary sale option. (price currently estimated between 11-20eth)\n2. We buy land in other metaverses as determined by voting within the metaverse discussion channel in discord. This may include a block within DCL, NFTWorlds, Matrix etc, but may be no further land if that is determined. Votes will go up, and a process will be implemented, following the successful approach of the NFT Flipping Committee. \n3. We approve the Apex Flip Leads to purchase the land (as they are NFTs) through their roles in the NFT Committee\n4. We buy such other metaverse tokens as determined by informal voting within the metaverse discussion discord, and we seek the multisig operators to implement this. This power will transferred to the Crypto Gods leading the Crypto Investment Committee should that BIP (currently in voting) pass.  These should be treated as crypto assets and the care for buying and selling be taken to ensure bears investment is best maximised. \n5. We allocated approximately 3-5eth of the metaverse funding to the building of land (if required, noting this figure may change by informal vote within discord). Bears have shown a keen interest to build in the metaverse, so this may not be required, but in the event we wish to proceed, it will enable us to set up an incredible hideout with monetisation options including links to launchpad\/merch\n\nRationale \u200c\n\nThe reasons for this proposal are :\n\n1.

To view the final proposal, click the above link for The First Brick 2.0.  \n\nApologies, proposal is being resubmitted due no announcement in BBH discord to enable all bears to see and vote. \n\nCreated: 09\/09\/2021\n\nImplementation: Immediate effect.\n\n1.0 - Buzzed Summary:\nThe proposal set forth here will define an organisational structure for the BBH. Designed with inspiration from the Index Coop, a proven and tested method of decentralised governance. This proposal will define the parameters for different working interest groups and their powers in relation to the BBH community and its resources.\n\n2.0 - Abstract:\nThe proposed change is to introduce titles for new working groups and broadly define their powers and responsibilities within the BBH community. If implemented, this proposal will lead to the creation of an official hierarchy, providing Bears with the structure and process they need to push forward their ideas. The proposed hierarchy is represented in the rudimentary figure detailed here: https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/bip-006-the-first-brick-2-0\/566\n\n3.0 - Motivation:\nAs a community we have been bursting out with valuable and credible ideas that have the potential to further the BBH DAO. Unfortunately, it is rare that these ideas are followed through with. A large reason for this is that motivated community members lack the guidance and defined processes and procedures necessary to make their voices and ideas heard. This diminishes the effectiveness of the DAO and impedes upon our ability to accomplish community goals.\n\n4.0 - Specification Overview:\nWhat it is that the proposal will do to solve the problem will be detailed in this section.\n\n4.1 \u2013 Groups & Roles:\n\nThis is where the proposed working groups are defined and labelled. The labels are Pods, Committees and The Community. Please refer to the full proposal link for further explanation.\n\n4.2 \u2013 Responsibilities:\n\nIn this section, the minimum non-negotiable requirements from Pods and Committees are set out. All groups\/roles will be required to operate in accordance with one simple principle:\n\nGrowth & Improvement: Whatever the goals are for your group, they must be designed to further the financial, strategic, or social interests of the BBH community and its members.\n\nPlease refer to the linked document for details of the minimum requirements for the Pods, Committees and The Community.\n\n4.3 - Limits & Power:\n\nThe powers sought by Committees must be adequately defined within the initial proposal. A committee operating outside of its remit may be disbanded following a community vote.\n\nAdditionally, the Community retains the right to end any working group at any time following the success of a community vote, irrespective of circumstances.\n\n4.4 - Remuneration:\n\nAll members that form a Committee are entitled to retroactive remuneration for their work and services to the BBH community. This work will be assessed for its impact to the BBH and appropriate remuneration will be distributed based upon that assessment.\n\nAt present, a potential remuneration \/ reward system being considered is Coordinape.com. This has the potential to make some minor changes to this proposal but those should be explained within the BIP that proposes Coordinape.\n\n5.0 - Rationale:\n\nThe proposal has been made because as a DAO we must protect ourselves from irresponsible use of community resources. After much consideration and discussion between the proposal team and even further conversation with our defi experts; we decided that a tiered group system enabling less restrictive oversight, but greater resource protection would be the ideal structure. This method would encourage more considered proposals that wish to utilise our resources but should also prevent voter fatigue from incessant, half-baked proposals.\n\nInitially our proposal was a much more rigid structure with a single working group (a committee). It was designed to establish rules for the formation of committees and their election processes. Due to the reasons discussed above, it was decided this wouldn\u2019t be an effective long-term solution.\n\n6.0 - Technical Specification:\n\nRefer full proposal.\n\n7.0 - Test Cases:\n\nA similar model of decentralised governance has been successfully tested and implemented at the Index Coop. A successful FTSE 500 organisation.\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.","protocol":"buzzedbearhideout","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9F666457E792101523d4dcb4715750c9bce68a02","totalVotes":65,"blockNumber":13540293,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/buzzedbears.eth\/proposal\/0x4cb3cb9099a50e77e58e7ba92a709dcd13800bdbf56f7d73091cdb8a68887a69","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1635894000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1636326000}","startTimestamp":1635894000,"endTimestamp":1636326000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['I agree with this proposal', 'I disagree with this proposal']","results":"[{'total': 1017, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

The template should be submitted at the end of each month on discord channel #bear-contributions with the correct format name.\n\nAt the beginning, rewards will be estimated and distributed by the founding team. The value should be estimated in USD and paid in Ethereum in the first weeks of the next month.\n\nSome funds of the honeypot must be allocated for this initiative.\n\nTherefore, if someone wants to dispute a reward, one of the Discord mods should be contacted to create a channel and then everyone can analyze the situation and get to a consensus.\n\nTemplate: Refer https:\/\/gov.buzzedbearhideout.com\/t\/proposal-rewards-for-contributers\/559\n\nRationale\nIn order to work as a DAO it is important to setup a reward system for people committed to the project be compensated.

With that said, there is one additional suggestion for the decision process. We suggest using the #buzzed-nft-shopping channel for all of the conversations and chatter surrounding which collections should be bought. @CryptoChicca can create a new channel called #bearly-liquid-decisions. This will be a locked channel where one of the APEX Leads will be able to post the collections up for purchase, and the rest of the DAO can use emojis to vote for which collection to purchase. This could facilitate speed and participation. \n\n*SUGGESTIONS are not required to be fulfilled by the NFT Flipping Committee.\n\nRationale \u200c  \nThe reasons for this proposal are : \nThe NFT Flipping Committee needs leaders\n \nCopyright \u200c  \nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0. \n","protocol":"buzzedbearhideout","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9F666457E792101523d4dcb4715750c9bce68a02","totalVotes":36,"blockNumber":13491274,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/buzzedbears.eth\/proposal\/QmS1pM7e2T3tEVpuep8ubWVFezyG1XTcsUQyUdgnPSB1Gk","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1635229800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1635575400}","startTimestamp":1635229800,"endTimestamp":1635575400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['@SQ X', '@LoopingNoob', '@RogueGremlin', '@runner8800', '@edgranja.eth', '@X dog']","results":"[{'total': 471, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 27, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 11, 'choice': 2}, {'total': 4, 'choice': 3}, {'total': 3, 'choice': 4}, {'total': 2, 'choice': 5}]","events":"[]"}

The name would appear on OpenSea. A naming ceremony will be held across dates to be set in November or December 2021 (approximately a week period to give bears a chance to action). All bears can be named for free during that period. Future naming can occur, but bear holders must pay gas to rename their bear. \n\nShould this be approved, the naming ceremony should be promoted on twitter and in discord, to enable people to buy bears before the naming ceremony and encourage new holders.\n\nMotivation \nSome of you may wish to name your bear, and create more of a personal experience. Creating a bond \/ attachment with your bear through not just a picture, but a name, will make it harder for people to let go of their bear, because it becomes part of their personality. This is also unique and something we can do for minimal cost to give benefit to bears, coz we are unique and like to do things different to the main pack. It also has the appearance that some bears may be more rare than others when they have a name and other bears do not. It will encourage buying before the naming ceremony and holding bears. It may encourage new bear holders.\n\nSpecification  Overview  \nDefijesus can make this happen. Cost will be minimal for a naming ceremony where all bears have the option to rename at once and this can be reimbursed from the honeypot. Future requests can be onerous and costly on a one off basis, and therefore, bear holders will need to pay gas. This approach is supported by votes in the hideout governance forum (see https above). \n\nRationale  \nThe reasons for this proposal are:\n1.\tPromoting the Buzzed Bear Hideout brand \n2.\tProviding extraneous benefits to Buzzed Bear holders\n3.\tMore growth means more revenue for Buzzed Bears \nIf you don\u2019t want to name your bear, you can just leave it with a number. This would be a choice. So those that wish to proceed can, and those that don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t have to. \n\nTechnical Specification  \nDefijesus can make this happen, if bear holders decide to approve this proposal. \n\nTest Cases \nGoonsNFT have released this naming concept with good feedback.  Street Dawgs have a naming concept open-ended. Pixelglyphs had a naming ceremony with once off naming. All cases were well received and people view Pixelglyph named NFTs as having greater rarity. This rewards holders.\n\nCopyright  \nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.","protocol":"buzzedbearhideout","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9F666457E792101523d4dcb4715750c9bce68a02","totalVotes":78,"blockNumber":13434248,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/buzzedbears.eth\/proposal\/QmZoGntFBcqDpu8uxmww3sDuT3pLFox9wPtDhCbzedqTtQ","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1634508000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1635483600}","startTimestamp":1634508000,"endTimestamp":1635483600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - I agree', \"No - I don't agree\"]","results":"[{'total': 1032, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 17, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This proposal is to provide operational guidance \/ permission to the second initiative to help implement the strategy from BIP-003 and provide the Bear NFT Flipping Committee with a mechanism to enable action. \n \nAbstract \u200c  \nA Bear NFT Flipping Committee will be formed to bring a formal structure to the pilot flipping program that has proved effective. This proposal is to provide operational support and enable that committee to be formalized with effective guidance. \n \nMotivation\nThe Bear NFT Flipping Committee has made some great buys, but there is a lack of clarity on how \/ when to flip, and when \/ what to repurchase. This proposal aims to provide guidance to those leading this committee. \n \nSpecification \u200c Overview \u200c  \nThe Bear NFT Flipping Committee should be led by @defijesus with 2 other trusted bears as support (referred to here on out as APEX Flip Leads). Each of those three Apex Flip Leads will lead the community NFT flipping and should have authority in the event of an inconsistency within the Bear NFT Flipping Committee. This may be the vote on \u2018what\u2019 is bought or around the price of selling, if there cannot be agreement between the Bears. Having 3 members will enable a clear decision. \n \nThe following are some suggestions from the community that have been pulled from the Discord server. They are placed here as a documented record of potential ideas, but not as requirements of the to-be-formed Bear NFT Flipping Committee:\n\n1) The committee will be responsible for coordinating buys, filtering suggestions, and organizing group votes for investment moves related to the Bear NFT Flipping Committee\n\n2) They will manage the eventual sales of honeypot owned assets\n\n3) Announce scheduled buying sessions. For example, this could look like a one-hour session where all are invited to give input and vote on purchases or sales. This would be a formalized version of the pilot session that took place. \n\n4) They should set emergency sell parameters. These would be a failsafe if there are significant drops in prices. For example, an emergency sale could be triggered to save the honeypot from larger losses without the initiation of a scheduled session.\n\n5) Organize a weekly check in to discuss what to buy, what to sell, what to hold. This could be a pure share of information that Bears could use for their own personal investments.\n\n6) Establish situational based rules which might include:\na) Minimum\/maximum time of holding: This prevents selling before pricing may be fully established or holding too long. Min\/max determined prior to purchase and disregards emergency sell parameters.\nb) Target sale price. Once target hit, can either sell immediately or wait to sell until the market begins rolling over (likely above but no less than target). Such targets and planned actions determined prior to purchase, may or may not be subject to min\/max time parameters.\nc) Voting procedure to decide if an asset that was designed for a short-term flip becomes a long term hold (potential blue chip)\n\n7) Such strategic elements cannot be disclosed broadly as they can be copied or gamed. I believe purchase\/sell strategy can and should be disclosed upon position exit, with proof\/validation of adhering to strategy. Basically a neutral (non-apex) party within the community that can validate strategy was adhered to without disclosing broadly, akin to a judge. \n\n8) Community at large can pitch ideas, vote on purchases and elements of strategy. Finalization and execution of strategy may be guided but not dictated by community\n\n9) The Bear NFT Flipping Committee be known as \u201cBearly Liquid\u201d\n\nTo repeat: the above are SUGGESTIONS and the actual procedures will be decided by the Apex Flip Leads once they have been elected.\n\nRationale \u200c  \nThe reasons for this proposal are : \n1) The current NFT flipping pilot that is running is handcuffed by lack of operational processes to achieve the goal of growing the Honeypot. The main reason for this proposal is to give formal structure to NFT flipping within the Buzzed Bears Hideout.\n2) Empowering additional ways to grow the Honeypot.\n3) Engaging the community to work together towards a common goal\n \nTechnical Specification \u200c  \nThis is an operational guidance proposal, to enable decisions to be made within the Bear NFT Flipping Committee, as governed by the Apex Flip Leads. The bears who request to be part of the Bear NFT Flipping Committee can elect to vote (not required) on the NFT flipping ideas suggested in an informal way within the committee itself, whether by thumbs up\/down, or as determined by the APEX Flip Leads to give best effectiveness to the outcome. The Apex Flip Lead(s) will have the final decision to act on behalf of the committee keeping in mind the best interests of bears and the popular community sentiment.\n \nThe following is the process for the initial election of the APEX Flip Leaders:\n1) Create a dedicated Discord channel for the Bear NFT Flipping Committee\na) This will be will be dedicated to the governance of the Bear NFT Flipping Committee and will serve a different purpose from the #buzzed-nft-shopping channel.\n2) Within this new channel, nominate either yourself or another Bear to be put onto the ballot for the role of APEX Flip Lead. Tag @n00bleLAND and @CryptoChicca when making your nominations.\n3) @n00bleLAND and @CryptoChicca will compile the list of everyone nominated.\n4) All nominations will be voted on in a formal Snapshot.\n5) Top 2 vote winners will become the first APEX Flip Leads alongside @defijesus.\n \nTest Cases \u200c \nThe Hideout has run a very successful pilot which resulted in the extremely successful purchase of CrypToadz at a low price. This pilot flipping session not only yielded profits for the honeypot, but it created a spike in engagement among the community members.\n \nCopyright \u200c  \nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0. \n \n\n","protocol":"buzzedbearhideout","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9F666457E792101523d4dcb4715750c9bce68a02","totalVotes":76,"blockNumber":13439326,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/buzzedbears.eth\/proposal\/QmZxmHhNbwzsXszg64vdRL2krQ1wm9613gtf2knuviTHUK","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1634529600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1634796000}","startTimestamp":1634529600,"endTimestamp":1634796000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['I agree with this proposal', 'I disagree with this proposal']","results":"[{'total': 1002, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

This will involve a payment of about 20m BZRX, or less than half of the liquid BZRX in the treasury directly to victims (no selling of BZRX). To be clear, this will also include setting up a new swap contract on BSC\/Polygon so that the people who did not swap their BGOV\/PGOV for BZRX before the attack, are now able to do so, including those who are PGOV\/BGOV LPs (since the BZRX bridged to BSC\/Polygon for this purpose has now been stolen).\n\n 2) The development team\u2019s personal losses of BZRX will also be compensated in full, but they will be paid in vBZRX (not BZRX) which will vest slowly until July 2024. This is done partly to maintain liquid BZRX funds in the treasury for the operation of the protocol and not empty the treasury and also as a gesture to the community and other victims of the attack who are having to accept a debt token and cannot be paid back immediately.\n\n 3) All other losses resulting from the attack (in all other tokens) will be compensated by issuing a debt token at a 25% premium to be repaid over time by the protocol from 30% of protocol revenue and fees (so protocol revenue breakdown will be 50% to Ooki\/BZRX holders, 30% to debt token and 20% to treasury). This approach has some similarities to what Pickle Finance and Indexed Finance did after their hacks, although there are differences.\nIn effect, the bZx DAO is making a commitment to repay the remaining losses over time, similar to a loan with a 25% premium.\nSpecifically, a tradable debt token will be issued with an initial face value of $1, and it will be given to victims in a 1.25:1 ratio to their losses. So for example, someone who lost $10,000 in the attack will receive 12,500 debt tokens nominally worth $12,500 when fully repaid (although the actual market value will vary and initially be much lower than that).\nThe DAO commits to using 30% of protocol fees earned on all 3 current deployments (BSC, Polygon, Ethereum), as well as all future deployments (unknown at this stage, but possibly Optimism, Arbitrum, AVAX, etc) to market buy the debt tokens at least once every month (possibly more) up to a token price of $1 (the face value of the token) until all the tokens are purchased and the losses from the attack are repaid in full (with premium). The once-a-month and 30% figure is a minimum - the DAO may choose to buy back more of the debt token at its discretion.\nAll attack victims who hold the debt tokens till the buyback is completed will therefore receive 125% of their losses in compensation in return for waiting. Victims can of course choose to sell or trade their debt tokens at any time, but the initial liquidity pool will be seeded at a price far below $1 in order to discourage the first claimants of the debt token from dumping their tokens into the liquidity pool in the first minutes and hours and making a profit at the expense of those who are slower to claim their tokens. Instead, the market price of the token will rise naturally over time as the debt token is bought back by the DAO and reward long-term holders.\n\n 4) Any assets recovered from the attacker (unknown at this time, although there is speculation that some of the USDT may be recoverable) will be given directly back to the victims who lost that particular token. So for example, if 50% of USDT is recovered, then it will be shared among all victims who lost USDT in proportion to their losses, and their allotment of the debt token accordingly reduced. However, this only applies until the debt token is issued and claimed. Once the debt token is issued, all recoveries will be used to market buy the debt token and benefit all victims equally. This is done to prevent double-dipping by victims of the recovered currency - you cannot get debt tokens for all your losses AND get a share of the recovered assets.\n\nForum Discussion Post: https:\/\/forum.bzx.network\/t\/consolidated-compensation-proposal-for-victims-of-5-nov-2021-bzx-attack\/573","protocol":"bzx","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x3e7fb3F9E9cd3649593c7e5fBe2A18C0C0179a36","totalVotes":18,"blockNumber":13640822,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bzx.eth\/proposal\/0x1c09762c97dcd04287cafde35b23d5421f88054b636245e4a0f909843990eea4","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637262000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637521200}","startTimestamp":1637262000,"endTimestamp":1637521200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Agree', 'Disagree']","results":"[{'total': 2957169.5, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Passage of this proposal approves all of the following updates to the BZRX token contract.\n\n- New ticker symbol to match the rebrand token name and ticker symbol.\n- Updating token contract to enable the ability for DAO vote to mint\/burn\n- Cheaper gas\n- Ability to increase total token supply and perform a 10:1 token split. (to benefit from unit bias)\n\nProposal Details\n\nThe migration of BZRX to a new token contract will consist of a corresponding increase in the total token supply in the amount of a 1:10 split. This ratio implies that for every 1 BZRX, there will be 10 of the new tokens given.\n\nThis split will increase the supply of BZRX and lead to a decrease in the price per unit.

These functionalities will enable mint and burn which will be wholly controlled by the DAO, such that the future token economic functions can be modified as necessary through a DAO proposal in order to enable burn and\/or mint of new tokens if the need arises.

Protocol\n\nB.Protocol is a backstop liquidity protocol for DeFi, handling liquidations in scale. B.Protocol v2 is pooling users\u2019 funds that are dedicated towards liquidations, using the B.AMM (Backstop AMM) novel design.\n\nProposal\n\nThis proposal would Integrate B.Protocol v2 with bZx to offer better liquidation ratios, and up to x15 leverage on specific trading pairs in Fulcrum, using 105% maintenance margin.\n\nThis proposal would also approve an allocation of 250k BZRX tokens that will be used towards incentive rewards for the backstop depositors. \n\nDetails\n\nSee forum post for discussion: https:\/\/forum.bzx.network\/t\/integrate-bzx-fulcrum-with-b-protocol-v2-over-polygon\/402\n\nThis proposal suggests starting with a pilot experiment over the MATIC\/USDC and the MATIC\/USDT trading pairs on Fulcrum over Polygon with x15 leverage on long positions, and with margin maintenance of 105% . \n\nFrom discussions held with the Polygon community we understand there is high interest for long MATIC positions with higher leverage than what the current platforms offer. As USDC and USDT are very liquid assets it will be easier to pool the needed liquidity for a strong user-based backstop.\n\nUsers' funds deposited into B.Protocol v2 will be held in an interest bearing QuickSwap USDC\/USDT pool while idle, and will be used for liquidating any unsafe MATIC\/USDC or MATIC\/USDT position whenever needed. The seized MATIC collateral will be sold back into USDC or USDT and be returned into the QuickSwap pool with any additional profits made during the liquidation and rebalancing process.\n\nIncentives: In order to incentivize early depositors into the backstop pool of USDC\/USDT, and in order to demonstrate the endless composability opportunities in DeFi, a joint Liquidity Mining program will be put in place, that will reward liquidity providers with BPRO, BZRX, (and perhaps also with QUICK and MATIC tokens).","protocol":"bzx","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x54E88185eB636c0A75d67dcCc70E9ABE169BA55e","totalVotes":9,"blockNumber":13269746,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bzx.eth\/proposal\/Qmd8xTvrhVjKq5fcyuPqyehk8GXMQQFHR4qbUSvYuZ4Br8","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1632234600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1632493800}","startTimestamp":1632234600,"endTimestamp":1632493800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Agree', 'Disagree']","results":"[{'total': 7721216.5, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

This included distance to an airport, maximizing freedom of zoning, ease of access via road, and available resources like water and power.

Any individual or entity wishing to create a proposal and put it up to vote will need to go through those steps to ensure that its proposal is detailed enough to be voted on and its implementation enforceable.\n\n# Motivation\nAs the DAO matures we have more citizens wanting to participate in governance. There has been confusion on how to do this. We need a process that is fair and easy to follow, while ensuring a bare minimum quality and avoiding voter fatigue.\n\n# Specification\nThe CityDAO governance process is primarily conducted using the [CIPs category ](https:\/\/forum.citydao.io\/c\/cips\/5). For a proposal to be accepted, it must successfully pass through three phases:\n\n## Phase 1: Ideation\nThis phase facilitates an initial, informal discussion on these forums regarding potential proposals. You can initiate a proposal in Phase 1 by posting your idea in the[ CIPs category ](https:\/\/forum.citydao.io\/c\/cips\/5) with the phase-1 tag. This phase allows proposals to gather community insight for refinement before opening a formal poll.\n\n**Duration:** Open-ended\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 1 to Phase 2, there is no formal requirement. However, if a Phase 1 proposal discussion fails to garner any momentum from the community, it is unlikely to become a successful proposal.\n\n## Phase 2: Specification\n\nThis phase requires proposals to be posted in a new dedicated thread the [CIPs category ](https:\/\/forum.citydao.io\/c\/cips\/5) using the CityDAO Improvement Proposal (CIP) template. You can create a CityDAO Improvement Proposal (CIP) easily by adding the CIP subcategory, after which your draft post will automatically be populated by a CIP template for you to fill in. You can move a proposal to Phase 2 by posting the CIP-# with the phase-2 tag.\n\nThe CIP template recommends that all proposals should contain the following fields when applicable , such as a Simple Summary, Abstract, Motivation and Specification.\nIn addition to these fields, Phase 2 proposals must also include a link to a 3-day long signalling poll on CityDAO Snapshot page about the proposal outcome (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the HIP post on the forum), and it must include the option *Make no changes*. The Phase 2 proposal poll on Snapshot **should be prefixed by [Signalling]** to differentiate them from binding Phase 3 proposal votes*. Each Citizen NFT gets one vote.\n\n> *In the near future, if we are able to create polls on the forum only open to Discourse accounts linked to a Citizen NFT, then the signalling poll could be done on the forum. This change would require a new CIP.\n\n**Duration:** 3 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to successfully pass from Phase 2 to Phase 3, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes on the snapshot poll. If the relative majority of votes on the snapshot poll indicates the result *Make no changes*, the proposal will not pass to Phase 3.\n\n## Phase 3: Consensus\n\nMove a proposal to Phase 3 by editing the CIP post from the previous phase to reflect the snapshot signalling poll result that received a relative majority of votes and by updating the proposal\u2019s tag to phase-3. This serves to refine the proposal for the final phase.\n\nAdditionally, a CityDAO proposal must be created on Snapshot (that contains the proposal text as well as a link to the CIP post on the forum), **it must be prefixed by [Binding]** and it must include the option *Make no changes*. Each Citizen NFT gets one vote.\n\n**Duration:** 7 days\n\n**Passing Requirement:** For proposals to be accepted in this final phase, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes in the Snapshot proposal. If the relative majority of votes on the proposal indicates the result *Make no changes*, the proposal will not be accepted and considered closed.\n\n---\n\nAny snapshot proposal not following these guidelines can be considered non-binding.\n\nMany thanks to teams in the ecosystem including PoH, Gnosis, Balancer and Uniswap, which inspired this governance process.\n\n# CIP Template\n\n```\nCIP: <Number to be assigned>\ntitle: <CIP title>\nauthor: <a list of the author's or authors' name(s) and\/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s),\nstatus: Draft\ncreated: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd) format>\nrequires (*optional): <CIP number(s)>\nreplaces (*optional): <CIP number(s)>\n```\n\n## Simple Summary\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nIf you can\u2019t explain it simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough. Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the CIP.\n\n## Abstract\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nA short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed.\n\n## Motivation\n\n(Required for Phase 1)\n\nThe motivation is critical for CIPs that want to allocate funding or change the DAO. CIP posts without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.\n\n## Specification\n\n(Required for Phase 2)\n\nThe technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for it to be reasoned about by participants in CityDAO.\n\n## Rationale\n\n(Recommended for Phase 2)\n\nThe rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.\n\n## Implementation\n\n(If necessary, recommended for Phase 3)","protocol":"citydao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xF49A19f72d0E106df462CfD6B5BEBE42b6001616","totalVotes":10,"blockNumber":13229297,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/daocity.eth\/proposal\/QmbJ1Jn4SCs6aURK2GeCBgYAe8A6PWHH7jXqXQRVYm7YWD","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1631696400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1631955600}","startTimestamp":1631696400,"endTimestamp":1631955600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Pass to Phase-3', 'Make no changes']","results":"[{'total': 11, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Trail of Bits will provide comprehensive software assurance services to mitigate this risk across three specific activities: consulting services, security engineering, and process creation.\n\nWe believe it is essential to create an easy-to-follow process with highly robust tools that makes security transparent, with or without a code review from Trail of Bits. We consider the primary goal as building capacity in the Compound ecosystem to secure itself. To that end, we will provide engineering efforts to develop critical security infrastructure and processes.\n\nTrail of Bits will be paid the equivalent of $1 million USD in COMP every quarter for one year to provide the baseline services. This payment is all-inclusive of all services defined in the proposal.\n\nTrail of Bits spoke on Discord at the Compound Community Dev Call and carved out [my part of the presentation](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1GYQ_A5EewK73ZtLZ_wvKpPFLYwCvVznX\/view?usp=sharing) so you can listen to it briefly since it may add color to the proposal.\n\n# Goals and Non-Goals\n\nGoals of this effort include:\n\n* Prevent insecure code from being merged into Compound through the governance process, and ensure that any remaining risks of proposals under consideration are well known before a vote. Compound desires services that eliminate and illuminate these risks.\n* Provide first-class security tools and analytical capabilities to Compound developers. Compound developers must have every opportunity to analyze their code and understand its security ramifications. Compound desires a variety of tools that enable thorough inspection of code by developers and users.\n* Create repeatable processes that build capacity for security and avoid dependence on external audits or third-party services for security. Security efforts should result in higher quality code being developed by the Compound community over time through the adoption of consistent processes.\n\nNon-goals of this effort include:\n\n* Deploy, configure, or maintain on-chain monitoring software. This goal does not address the security of governance proposals. These systems are an active field of research, may apply to fewer attacks than expected, or may have undesirable performance costs. Instead, we will commit to evaluating their opportunities and limitations during the project.\n* Further development of the bug bounty program. We support the formation of a [bug bounty proposal](https:\/\/www.comp.xyz\/t\/bug-bounty-program-for-compound-proposals\/2590) to specifically address this issue. We will provide consultative advice to this proposal based on our years of [experience](https:\/\/blog.trailofbits.com\/2019\/01\/14\/on-bounties-and-boffins\/) seeing both ends of the bounty ecosystem.\n\n# Description of the Services\n\n## 1. Consulting services\n\nTrail of Bits will provide at least one full-time security engineer, with additional engineers supporting the project as needed, to perform the following consulting services:\n\n* **Maintain a presence on Discord and the Compound forums.** We will actively engage in conversation, reach out to developers as needed, and identify any new proposals.\n* **Provide proposal authors with 1:1 counseling sessions.** We will host a video call with the author to understand their goals and provide immediate feedback, including on the architectural design of their proposal and suggestions to reduce complexity.\n* **Review and report any identified security issues in the code for proposals.** We will describe the issue, a scenario to abuse it, and a recommendation to address it. We will work with proposal authors to validate fixes that result from these reports.\n* **Define security properties for proposals.** We will work with the authors to provide reasonable security invariants alongside the proposal and tests for them in Certora, Echidna, or other tools, as appropriate for the specific invariants under test.\n* **Document \u201cSecurity Considerations\u201d for every proposal.** We will contribute a standardized section to reviewed proposals to inform developers and users of limitations, risks, or other considerations to form an opinion about their vote on it.\n* **Provide our analysis directly to the community.** Before a vote on any governance issue, we will host a public community call, walk attendees through the documented Security Considerations, and run test suites, fully informing their decisions to vote.\n* **Host bi-weekly Office Hours with developers.** We will cover testing and verification tools, demonstrate new security processes and tools for Compound, and solicit feedback for new areas of development and guidance needed by the community.\n* **Evaluate new security techniques for adoption by Compound.** We will perform detailed evaluations of the applicability of these techniques *directly on the Compound codebase*, sharing our empirical results of efficacy and utility.\n* **Ad-hoc services sourced from across Trail of Bits**, as needed. This includes expertise from our separate teams for cryptography, application security, cloud-native security, threat modeling, machine learning, and other research teams. Our firm employs more than 80 researchers servicing clients in tech, defense, and finance on high-risk security challenges.\n\n## 2. Security engineering\n\nTrail of Bits will engineer solutions in software to critical security risks faced by Compound. We will ensure that first-class security tools are available, easy to use, and customized for use on Compound, with knowledge of Compound-specific risks built in.\n\n* **Ensure that [Slither](https:\/\/github.com\/crytic\/slither), our static analysis framework, and [Echidna](https:\/\/github.com\/crytic\/echidna), our rapid security property tester, always work on Compound code.** These security tools are delicate machines that must ingest all code possible to write in Solidity and EVM. We will ensure that no breaking changes affect Compound for an extended period of time and these tools always \"just work.\"\n* **Customize Slither and Echidna to the Compound codebase.** We will extend each tool to understand Compound\u2019s architecture, expected security properties, and third-party protocols, vastly enhancing their depth of results. For example, we can build static analyses that understand and aggregate data from Certora properties or that understand specific Compound interfaces.\n* **Customize Slither to evaluate the security of upgrades.** Upgradeability exposes low-level complexity with possibly disastrous results. Slither already [evaluates for 17 such flaws](https:\/\/github.com\/crytic\/slither\/wiki\/Upgradeability-Checks), and we will enhance this analysis with Compound-specific conditions.\n* **Develop scaffolding for new proposals with pre-integrated security analyses** from Slither, Echidna, Certora, or others, as appropriate. These templates will provide secure beginnings for parameter changes, new tokens, protocol features, and governance changes.\n* **Continuously define and evaluate security properties across the Compound codebase** with analyses from Slither, Echidna, Certora, or other techniques, as appropriate. New proposals may expose under-specified areas of Compound that require greater formalization. We will work to fill in these gaps with new properties.\n\n## 3. Repeatable processes\n\nTrail of Bits will build the capacity of the Compound community to secure itself, minimizing dependency on external security audits for security and most efficiently using their time when engaged. We will define and socialize repeatable processes that encapsulate common tasks with security integrated within them. Adoption of these processes will set a floor on proposal quality, continuously secure proposals regardless of security auditor review, and improve the quality of proposals over time.\n\n* **Design a repeatable process for starting a new proposal.** We will develop onboarding guidance for developers that describes the end-to-end process for securely creating new proposals. Touchpoints will include security training, using pre-created templates, example security properties, guidance on tools, self-assessment, engaging with Trail of Bits for code review.\n* **Design a repeatable process for proposal [self-assessment](https:\/\/github.com\/cncf\/tag-security\/blob\/main\/assessments\/guide\/self-assessment.md)**. We will provide guidance to assess the security of proposals before sharing them publicly. This will facilitate more effective conversations about security with the community and Trail of Bits, knowing that an initial baseline has been met.\n* **Design a repeatable process for risk assessment by the community.** We will share the risk factors that security experts focus on when reviewing proposals and document steps to run testing and verification tools, thus providing a map for those voting on proposals to become better informed and obtain empirical evidence.\n* **Design a repeatable process for evaluating [third-party protocol integration risks](https:\/\/github.com\/crytic\/building-secure-contracts\/blob\/master\/development-guidelines\/token_integration.md).** We will design a repeatable process to investigate the security considerations of new token implementations and other linkages to DeFi building blocks from Compound. We will document existing pitfalls and concerns in third-party code already used by Compound, and facilitate the discovery and documentation of others.\n* **Design a repeatable process for other protocols to securely integrate with Compound.** In the reverse of the above, we will describe security considerations for DeFi users of Compound. In our mind, any compromise involving Compound, even if it does not originate from our own code, will compromise its reputation.\n* **Regularly update a \u201ctreasure map\u201d for bug hunting in Compound.** We will guide other security researchers to less specified, more risky areas of the code. We will regularly report statistics on these identified hotspots, such as % coverage for specifications.\n\n# Risks\n\nCompound may have unknown, latent security vulnerabilities already present in the code. Our proposal focuses on new code added to Compound and, therefore, these issues may continue undiscovered. To mitigate this risk, we have included a) a task focused on specifying new security properties, as needed, and b) a task to build a treasure map to aid other bug hunters.\n\nCOMP holders may vote for proposals that contain documented security risk or that are otherwise highly risky, considering the reward to be greater in that circumstance. To mitigate this risk, we will a) add documented Security Considerations to every proposal and b) host a community call to walk through those considerations, demonstrate how to run included test suites, and evaluate the coverage of them.\n\nCompound is highly complex and new proposals may use new features of Solidity or combine features of Solidity in ways that break the security tools upon which it depends. To mitigate this risk, Trail of Bits has specifically prioritized the development and testing of new features for Slither and Echidna against the Compound codebase.\n\nProposals may require swift approval without waiting for input from Trail of Bits, or input from Trail of Bits may be otherwise unavailable within the timeframe required due to unknown circumstances. To mitigate this risk, Trail of Bits has proposed a robust sequence of processes and tools for the community to enhance trust in themselves and better understand the risks of their actions.\n\n# Financial Terms\n\nTrail of Bits will be streamed the equivalent of $4 million USD in COMP (at today's price) for one year to provide the services. This payment is all-inclusive of all services defined in the proposal.","protocol":"compound","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc44F30Be3eBBEfdDBB5a85168710b4f0e18f4Ff0","totalVotes":9,"blockNumber":13811448,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13811448}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13831158}","startTimestamp":1639594089,"endTimestamp":1639857550,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR', 'ABSTAIN']","results":"[{'total': 3531.6396, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 171627.53, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

{"refId":"cHJvcG9zYWw6Y29tcG91bmQ6ZGVmYXVsdDo3NQ==","id":"75","title":"Decentralized long-term security for Compound","content":"# Overview\n\nWe live in a new world where more and more DAOs are in control of a project. Ensuring that safe choices are made is a major challenge and DAOs have been exploring different approaches. According to current proposals, Compound would effectively outsource their security to a vendor who would take care of various security-related needs.\n\nWe believe that this approach is not the route to take. The chosen audit company would become a critical dependency for the protocol. The suggested solutions with their intransparent, quarterly, lump-sum payment for a mix of services do not focus on the most effective tools. Hence, we would like to suggest a process that can leverage the strength of the security community.\nThe main security challenge for a protocol like Compound is the growing complexity that needs to be taken into account with every change.\n\n* Compound needs to ensure compatibility, failure to do so can have significant consequences.\n* Integrations must not be affected by the proposed changes.\n* Compound protocol grows and contracts must still interact correctly. \n\nOverall, we conclude that such systems exhibit quadratic complexity growth. To tackle this, we aim for scalability. Furthermore, we believe that the security can best be ensured by a broad base of security providers. This prevents any form of vendor lock-in and conflicts of interest, while allowing to combine the strengths of different providers.\n\n# Process in a Nutshell\n\nWith this proposal, Compound Governance will allocate the necessary funds to onboard two independent top-tier auditors at current market prices assuming that each one of them provides the capacity to review 150% of the RFPs voted on in 2021, providing in total a capacity of 300% over the needs of 2021.\n\nTo ensure that Compound has competent code auditors at their proposal, the following process would be enacted:\n\n* Compound Governance votes in several code reviewers each year to onboard into auditing through a paid training phase.\n* Auditors apply to become wardens of Compound by providing:\n  * An example of how a code review for the Comptroller and the cToken would be performed, detailing methods and time required.\n  * The cost and amount of hours reserved for Compound per quarter, which are if accepted guaranteed to be paid by Compound.\n  * The expected compensation for the training phase.\n* Onboarding code reviewers can also greatly benefit from the existing audit suite which contains many relevant attack scenarios.\n* Any time reserved for Compound not spent on reviewing code or RFPs is used to improve this audit suite.\n* Auditors who are selected by Governance and complete the training take shared ownership of the audit suite and collectively improve the coverage.\n* Delivering good work in improving the Compound Audit Suite will likely be used to evaluate the quality of the auditor which aligns interests long-term by increasing the likelihood of being voted in again next year.\n\nThe following process focuses on prevention and consists of 5 steps to be executed for each RFP:\n\n1. Early feedback during RFP stage with code reviewers adding security consideration paragraphs\n2. Perform thorough code review of newly developed code\n3. Develop an audit suite\n4. Leverage tool-based analysis where efficiently possible\n5. Perform the Proposal Verification\n\n# Benefits of the Audit Suite\n\nConsidering all the benefits explained in detail in the forum post, we believe that the audit suite can provide the necessary scalability by capturing a lot of the growing complexity. It requires an initial investment to build it up, but we consider it worthwhile.\n\n# Cost & Next Steps\n\nFor the first year, the total cost per auditor is expected to not exceed $1\u2019370\u2019000, which would cover 8 auditor-weeks of initial training ($170\u2019000 one-time) and 24 auditor-days per month (quarterly fee of $300\u2019000). This amount of auditor-days will cover the needs of Compound if 150% the capacity of 2021 will be required. For administration and maintenance of the program, an independent service provider with expertise in project management and IT safety will be chosen by Compound Governance with a compensation of $80\u2019000 \/ year.\nTo ensure that all of these services can be provided with high quality, ChainSecurity commits to provide an offer as one of the auditors not exceeding the caps mentioned above. We will also source at least one independent provider to maintain the program for consideration by Compound Governance and hand over control over the Gnosis Safe MultiSig to this provider once they are confirmed by Compound Governance.\nThe initial request will cover the initial training for two auditors ($340\u2019000 in COMP) and a streaming grant to cover audit cost at the cap for two auditors and the project maintainer ($620\u2019000 per quarter) at $200 \/ COMP and 6500 blocks\/day. A proposal for adjustment of the streaming grant to align COMP value with the value in USD will be done quarterly. Funds remaining at the end of the year in the MultiSig will be returned to Compound Governance.\n\n# Closing words\n\nOur suggestion incentivizes broad participation from small to large security companies. Thereby, it broadens the base of experts in Compound and leverages proven techniques. Using the audit suite, we can aggregate the knowledge and insights from multiple audits (instead of only relying on the last audit) and thereby tackle the growing complexity. We believe that this provides a viable long-term solution.\nWhile even a single audit company chosen to shepherd the protocol could write such an audit suite, only by having multiple companies who rely on each other to have covered critical parts of the system enforces that a public, high-quality audit suite gets created. It also allows every security provider to play to their strengths when contributing. Lastly, it allows a decentralized verification of proposals by any community member.\n\n# Reference\n[Forum post with details](https:\/\/www.comp.xyz\/t\/auditing-compound-protocol\/2543\/27?u=chainsecurity)","protocol":"compound","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xE6604Cc8d9Bc49f7DbF9e7f9FbF91A7d7bB6B1F8","totalVotes":4,"blockNumber":13811268,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13811268}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13830978}","startTimestamp":1639591752,"endTimestamp":1639855274,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR', 'ABSTAIN']","results":"[{'total': 3531.6396, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

This function behaves the following way:\n- If the user's amount of accrued COMP is greater than the amount they over-accrued, the amount over-accrued is subtracted from their accrued amount (compAccrued).\n- If the user's amount of accrued COMP is less than the amount they over-accrued (i.e. they successfully claimed more COMP than they should have), their accrued amount (compAccrued) is set to 0 and the difference (i.e. what they owe the protocol) is saved to compReceivable. This new storage variable is only used for record-keeping at the moment.\n- An event - CompReceivableUpdated - is emitted when compReceivable is updated.\n- An event - CompAccruedAdjusted - is emitted when this function updates compAccrued.\n\nNote: Record-keeping for the users who _successfully claimed more COMP than they should have and then subsequently returned the funds_ will have to be updated in a different proposal.\n\nSince this proposal corrects all of the amounts of over-accrued COMP, the functionality of claimComp has been restored for all users.\n\nUpon execution of this proposal, Compound protocol will return to its fully functioning state.\n\n## Verification\n\nEveryone is encouraged to verify that the list of users along with their over-accrued amounts exactly matches the output of [the script](https:\/\/github.com\/TylerEther\/compound-tools\/blob\/main\/scripts\/proposal-62-bug\/find-affected-accounts.js) used to create this list.\n\n## Review\n\nThis proposal has only been thoroughly reviewed by myself, so I urge everyone to also thoroughly review this proposal before voting on it.\n\nThe proposal has been simulated from a fork of mainnet at block #13380217.

With Iron Bank launching on Fantom, we can extend the same practice to Fantom, and work with Yearn for the greater market.\n\n## Specification\n\nOnce the voting has passed, the team will begin the transition to Fantom Iron Bank.\n\nDuring the transition, user can access Fantom Iron Bank through both C.R.E.A.M. Finance and Yearn frontend. It will be a roughly four weeks transition period, with start date and end date to be announced.

Once thats audited and live, Armor will also move all the reward emission token allocations to that special contract, as well as release the new masterchef contract as open source. \n\n========Contents above are drafted by az========\nDiscussion link: [Proposal: Add arNXM and ARMOR as collateral assets on CREAM Ethereum with 60% collateral factor](https:\/\/forum.cream.finance\/t\/proposal-add-arnxm-and-armor-as-collateral-assets-on-cream-ethereum-with-60-collateral-factor\/1438)\n","protocol":"creamfinance","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB","totalVotes":43,"blockNumber":12542843,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/cream-finance.eth\/proposal\/QmSU6aYHKqQeuVqQ937jyt3cFjR6EbQT6VNKa9smAD3mCb","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1622475000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1622734200}","startTimestamp":1622475000,"endTimestamp":1622734200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 65.34915, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 28.797522, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Wootrade is a liquidity solution and trading network used by 20+ institutions. The community is rapidly growing and as of now, the token isn\u2019t listed on any other lending platforms in the DeFi space. This would be a good opportunity to introduce Cream Finance to an active community of DeFi users. Wootrade is also very vocal and eager to integrate and support other DeFi platforms.\n\n\n**For**\n> Add WOO as a collateral asset\n\n**Against**\n> Do nothing\n\n## Additional Details\n\nCoinGecko ranking: 143\n\nMarket cap: ~600m USD\n\nToken holders: ~7000 (Ethereum)\n\nCurrent markets: Huobi (spot and futures), Gate, MXC, AscendEx (Formerly BitMax), WOO X Beta, Uniswap (ETH and USDC), SushiSwap (USDC), Bancor, Hoo\n\n*Wootrade can be simplified into three main parts:*\n\n1. A B2B institutional trading network\n\n2. WOO X Beta, an exchange for active traders\n\n3. DeFi liquidity solution with on-chain capital\n\nAll three are related to Wootrade\u2019s key strength, which is providing the cheapest liquidity in the space. Wootrade does this by using a zero-fee method, which they are able to provide due to their background as institutional quantitative market makers (Kronos Research). The founders have extensive experience at top traditional finance firms like BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, etc. They are backed by top VCs including Dragonfly Capital, Three Arrows Capital, and Fenbushi Capital.\n\n## Integrations in DeFi to date:\n\nWOO\/ETH on Uniswap - TVL: $17.2 m\n\nWOO\/USDC on Uniswap\n\nWOO\/USDC on SushiSwap\n\nWOO\/BNT on Bancor\n\nWOO\/USDT on Mdex\n\n## Token Security:\n\nWOO does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The Wootrade ERC-20 contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint\/burn capabilities. WOO is a capped-supply token with a total supply of 3 billion tokens and circulating supply of 432,413,779.00 WOO. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration (top 10 and >1% of circulating supply) of WOO tokens are the token vesting contracts, one Huobi wallet, one Bitmax wallet, team wallets and a wallet with 1.86%.\n\n## Community and Communication\n\nWootrade is active on Reddit and Telegram. The Wootrade team also operates official Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Medium accounts. Github activity is limited to the Wootrade documentation, with activity since 27th August, 2019. The development team is presented on the Wootrade website. The team integrates Kronos Research co-founders Jack Tan and Mark Pimentel.\n\nThe team's official e-mail contact is admin@woo.network.\n\n## Token Distribution\n\n[WOO holder list](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0x4691937a7508860f876c9c0a2a617e7d9e945d4b#balances)\n\n443,484,750 \/ 2,992,996,746 WOO are unlocked.

BIFI is the governance token of beefy.finance, a cross-chain yield optimizer with over $700M in TVL.\n\n### Action Item\n**For**\n> Add BIFI as collateral asset\n\n**Against**\n> Do nothing\n\n## Motivation\nBeefy Finance was the first yield optimizer on Binance Smart Chain, launching in September 2020 during the platform\u2019s infancy. It has since expanded to HECO, AVAX, Polygon, and Fantom. Beefy currently has 200+ vaults continues to move fast, deploy new vaults, and launch on new platforms.\n\n## BIFI Token\nBIFI serves as a governance and revenue sharing token. A percentage of vault profits are shared with token stakers. The token supply is fixed and all distribution has been completed.\n\n## Benefits for Cream\nBeefy Finance is one of the most popular yield optimizers on all platforms. Its multichain strategy aligns with Cream's own values. BIFI\u2019s presence on Cream would provide additional TVL to Cream and an opportunity to earn additional fees as BIFI holders would come to Cream to collateralize their assets.\n\n## Current liquidity\n* $12M on Pancake, $5M on MDEX, $3.2M on Apeswap\n* Some liquidity on Polygon DEXs\n* Available on Binance, MXC, Hotbit\n\n## Links\n**Platform**\n* [App](https:\/\/app.beefy.finance\/)\n* [Stats](https:\/\/dashboard.beefy.finance\/)\n* [Docs](https:\/\/docs.beefy.finance\/beefyfinance\/faq-1\/tokenomics-and-governance)\n* [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/beefyfinance)\n\n**Social**\n* [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/beefyfinance)\n* [Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/beefyfinance)\n* [Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/beefyfinance)\n\n**Other**\n* [Certik audit](https:\/\/certik.org\/projects\/beefyfinance)\n* [Binance Listing](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/support\/announcement\/f616b3b12724418eb8de89ce58fe3c27)","protocol":"creamfinance","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x6d5a83DdeF5e4c5E6fCEcDd8c4365e1f5151e78f","totalVotes":27,"blockNumber":12449307,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/cream-finance.eth\/proposal\/QmRvFFecXgnKyGgv6LdKKsnAmRz9HgVHD5itM3mJ1YhVzz","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1621227600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1621486800}","startTimestamp":1621227600,"endTimestamp":1621486800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 2052.7485, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Nominees should decide on Listings, Collateral Cap, Collateral Factors and Reserve Factors. This will enable much quicker governance decisions and also allow CREAM to avoid listing all new tokens as 0% collateral. \n\n**For**\n> Create two types of proposals with different parameters which affect the length and execution of a proposal.\nCreate a C.R.E.A.M. Listing Committee\n\n**Against**\n> Do nothing\n\n## Motivation\n\nC.R.E.A.M. community members have voting fatigue because they need to approve small changes to the protocol. Currently, the governance forum is overloaded with requests related to assets listing and Collateral Factors. Consequently, critical proposals are lost among others. \n\nThe C.R.E.A.M. protocol development process is slowed down, participation rates are relatively low, and discussion is not encouraged enough. This is mainly due to a lack of structure, order and clarity, leading to a messy governance process.\n\nCurrently, the community votes on every Collateral Factor and new asset. This has a number of issues:\n\n* Creates voting fatigue for token holders because they\u2019re asked to vote so frequently\n* Dilutes bigger governance changes \n\nCreating a listing committee will make speed up new listings. The community can still make proposals for new assets to be added to C.R.E.A.M. platform. The proposal above attempts to balance speed of iteration with avoiding a descent into plutocracy. This will onboard more collateral to increase TVL and fees.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Light Proposals**\n\nLight proposals would include:\n\n* Asset Listing\n* Reserve Factors\n* Collateral Factors\n* Collateral Caps\n\nWhat is included in governance proposals labeled as Light Proposals could evolve over time, and anyone is free to make suggestions.\n\nLight proposals would be handled by a Listing Committee, who must make a binary decision. If YES wins (at least 3 positive votes), they have to reach an agreement on Reserve & Collateral Factors as well as Collateral Cap, within 2 days.\n\n**Critical proposals**\n\nThey require more voting time, a higher vote differential, and are not handled by a specific Committee.\nThis is where the main strength of decentralized governance comes into play: community members should be able to express their opinion directly or at worst delegate their voting rights to trusted actors. Critical Proposals are the ones which must go through the full governance proposal lifecycle (we are planning to propose some updates here soon).\n\n**Listing Committee**\n\nThe 5 Nominees must have a diversified background to foster discussion while remaining flexible and agile to move fast. We believe that the ideal committee looks something like this:\n\n* 2 C.R.E.A.M. Core Team members\n* 2 active community members\n* 1 lending protocol (other than C.R.E.A.M.) active contributor\n\nThis design was inspired by the [Synthetix Spartan Council](https:\/\/blog.synthetix.io\/the-spartan-council-has-now-been-elected\/).\n\n*Voting*\n\nEach Nominee would receive an NFT that gives him or her 1 vote. If enough voters amend their votes such that someone who is not a council member ranks higher than a council member, then the the DAO will manually retrieve the NFT from the departing Nominee and issue it to the new Nominee, giving them Nominee voting rights. \n\nC.R.E.A.M. DAO will need to create a modified version (or custom contract) of an NFT which can be revoked and issued to EOA\u2019s (Externally Owned Addresses), signifying a wallet is part of the Listing Committee.\n\nEach parameter - Collateral Cap, Collateral Factor, and Reserve Factor - requires a minimum of three positive votes, in order to be listed. Nominees can also make proposals on new assets to list, and should discuss asset listing related community proposals in the forum.\n\nMinimum proposal length is 24 hours and maximum is set to 5 days.\n\n*Election*\n\nNominees election period would last 7 days, and would be renewed every 3 months. Existing Nominees from the current Listing Committee Epoch can remain on the Committee but will still be able to be voted out via people changing their votes in the poll.\n\nIn case of emergency, token holders can vote out a Nominee if the decisions made are not considered as aligned with the interests of C.R.E.A.M. Finance. The number of seats can be modified via an Improvements Proposal.\n\n*Limited Powers & DAO Discretion*\n\nThe C.R.E.A.M. DAO has a veto power and can require a revote at its discretion, but this should happen only in emergency situations - the processes should all be optimized to minimize this potential occurrence.\n\nRewards\n\nAssets listing, Collateral Cap, Reserve Factors and Collateral Factors are strategic parameters to ensure the longevity of the protocol. Such changes are highly related to downside risk of the whole protocol. \n\nTherefore, Nominees need to be incentivized: they will get 25 CREAM tokens per month as rewards, which would vest over a 12-month period.","protocol":"creamfinance","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xb6e362900B7113F246A7e1c17E9746b3B9C079dB","totalVotes":57,"blockNumber":12419041,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/cream-finance.eth\/proposal\/QmeLPHwPdELd9NN1PfEGeoLejh9xMmxpCS8G2XZL2efz4p","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1620817200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1621422000}","startTimestamp":1620817200,"endTimestamp":1621422000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 37822.508, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

As the first three of these assets have now gone live for borrowing and lending, the next logical step is to allow users to collateralize their vault tokens and borrow against them. This will bring greater TVL to C.R.E.A.M. and also drive borrowing demand, increasing returns to depositors and to the protocol itself. \n\n## Background\n\nC.R.E.A.M. currently has two v1 yVault tokens listed as collateral\u2014yUSD and yETH, both listed at 60% collateral ratio. Thus, this proposal matches the current standard by allowing 60% collateral ratio, and also recognizes the stability of assets denominated in USD and ETH that are also yield-bearing. Furthermore, this proposal acts in continuation of the [previously announced merger](https:\/\/medium.com\/iearn\/yearn-cream-v2-merger-e9fa6c6989b4) between C.R.E.A.M. and Yearn and the milestones that were outlined. \n\nYearn Finance is an aggregator service for decentralized finance (DeFi) investors, using automation to allow them to maximize profits from yield farming.

A few examples: \n\n-    Giveaways\n-    Corgi NFT lottery (proceeds to CorgiDAO)\n-    Signed Corgi auctions (proceeds to charity & CorgiDAO)\n-    Funding for content creators\n-    Corgi community tournament :eyes: \n\nAll these activities are planned to roll out in the near future and will be made possible by this proposal. The remaining corgis will be seen as a strategical investment by the CorgiDAO as we believe the current price range is favorable for a longer term investment.","protocol":"cryptocorgis","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x6662304e3198C8D54530fBdf02A869fA84537639","totalVotes":75,"blockNumber":13085067,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/crypto-corgis.eth\/proposal\/QmWsMoBt397Vx8XEXjfP5xQ7m782bSunS3MhMEbBpzFhVV","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1629768900}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1629856800}","startTimestamp":1629768900,"endTimestamp":1629856800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 356, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

To prevent the DAO getting front-ran, some mods have - at their risk - already purchased some of these 25 Corgis, and will transfer them to the DAO at cost (purchase price+gas fees) should this Proposal pass.\n\nLiquidity pools provide liquidity to those who need it, and newcomers with a wide variety of corgis to chose from at a fair price. They are considered a 'must have' by many for NFT's with 10.000 collection size, and if users start them they often end up illiquid as nobody is willing to start it in size. There is a good reason liquidity pools can be found on most of the 'roadmaps' of NFT projects. It would give the Corgi DAO a first stake in Corgis, as well as additional revenues. Once set up by the DAO, every Corgi can join and share the same benefits. \n\nThe initial size of this is to be cautious with DAO funds, this is meant as a small first step, that will be expanded if deemed beneficial by the community.

As active members in the community, ICE Poker guild owners and players are crucial in the long-term success of Decentral Games and ICE Poker, and the ecosystem will be stronger if they participate in governance.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nFour initiatives to incentivize ICE Poker guild owners and players to hold xDG and participate in Decentral Games governance:\n\n1. Airdrop 500 xDG per wearable to ICE Poker wearables owners, and 50 xDG to each delegated player\n\n2. Make Premium ICE Poker guild management tools accessible only to ICE Poker guild owners that hold 1k xDG per wearable\n\n3. Create three tiered ICE Poker guild leagues with monthly prizes in xDG\n\n4. Create player leaderboard with monthly prizes in ICE Poker wearables and xDG accessible only to delegated players that hold 100 xDG \n\n\n**1. xDG Airdrop to ICE Poker Wearables Owners and Players** \n\nAll current ICE Poker wearables holders will be airdropped 500 xDG and all delegated players will be airdropped 50 xDG in order to kickstart the best ecosystem distribution.\n\n*The airdrop will be 500 xDG per ICE Poker wearable and 50 xDG per delegated player held at the time of the snapshot. If you hold 12 ICE Poker wearables at the time of the airdrop, you will receive 6,000 xDG.*\n\n- Snapshot of wearables and delegated players will be taken at 6pm UTC, Feb 25th\n- Airdrop of xDG will happen at 6pm UTC, Feb 28th\n\n**2. Premium Guild Management Tools**\n\nAll ICE Poker guild owners will still have access to the Basic ICE Poker Guild management tools, and there will be a 1k xDG requirement per wearable to gain access to premium ICE Poker Guild management tools.\n\n*For example, if a guild has only 2 wearables, they unlock all features with only 2,000 xDG; if a guild has 12 wearables, they must maintain a balance of 12,000 xDG to unlock all features.*\n\nBasic ICE Poker Guild Package\n\n- Able to mint during ICE Poker wearables drops (with current 1k xDG requirement)\n- Native delegation of ICE wearables \n- Trustless daily revenue share and payouts\n\nPremium ICE Poker Guild Package\n*Features available for guilds who meet staking requirement (1k xDG per wearable)*\n\n- Delegation dashboard \n    - See historical performance per player\n    - Delegate and undelegate from the dashboard\n    - View historical ICE earnings of your guild\n- Ability to name your guild and players\n- Access to ICE Poker player lookup tool to allow guild owners to see past performance of a player before delegating (in development)\n- Ability to add a manager to your guild who can view your delegation dashboard and make delegations\/undelegations on your behalf (in development)\n\nAdditional premium features will be developed over time to further improve the ICE Poker guild management experience.\n\n**3. ICE Poker Guild Leagues**\n\nBased on your guild size and respective xDG stake, your guild can join an ICE Poker league, featuring month-long seasons with prizes distributed in xDG.\n\n*To qualify for an ICE Poker league, you must meet the xDG staking requirement at any time during the season.*\n\n5k xDG (5+ Players) - Fren League\n- 1st place: $2k in xDG\n- 2nd place: $1k in xDG\n- 3rd place: $500 in xDG\n- 4th place: $250 in xDG\n- 5th place: $100 in xDG\n\n10k xDG (10+ Players) - Ape League\n- 1st place: $5k in xDG\n- 2nd place: $2.5k in xDG\n- 3rd place: $1.3k in xDG\n- 4th place: $700 in xDG\n- 5th place: $350 in xDG\n\n25k xDG (25+ Players) - Chad League\n- 1st place: $10k in xDG\n- 2nd place: $5k in xDG\n- 3rd place: $3k in xDG\n- 4th place: $1.5k in xDG\n- 5th place: $750 in xDG\n\n*Note: We will not start distributing prizes until assigned seating is live.*\n\nExtra Chad League Feature: Submit name\/logo to create custom non-ICE guild wearables (via a template for shirts, polos, jerseys, or hoodies) for 25k ICE, plus 500 ICE per wearable. Guild owners will be able to mint these for their players to wear to represent their guild during gameplay.\n\nScoring\n\nEach guild will receive a Guild Score calculated by: \n\nGuild score = (net chips)\/(number of wearables active)^0.9\n\nNet chips = total net winnings of all the players within your guild within the season time frame\nNumber of wearables active = maximum number of wearables active in your guild at any point during the season \n\nThe 5 top scoring guilds of each ICE Poker league will receive xDG prizes claimable at the end of the season.\n\nRules\n\n- You are removed from the league if you drop below the xDG staking requirement mid-season\n- You can join any league mid-season, but you can only join one league per season\n- If you join a league mid-season, your Guild Score is only based on the player data after you join\n\n**4. Delegated Player Leaderboard with Monthly Prizes in Wearables and xDG**\n\nAll delegated players who hold 100 xDG will be included on a delegated player leaderboard based on net chips featuring monthly prizes in wearables and xDG: \n\n- 1st place: ICE wearable \n- 2nd place: ICE wearable\n- 3rd place: ICE wearable\n- 4th place: $500 in xDG\n- 5th place: $250 in xDG\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe 500 xDG airdrop per wearable and 50 xDG airdrop per delegated player will reward early ICE Poker guild owners and players, and position the Decentral Games community for growth and highly engaged governance participation going forward. \n\nPremium ICE Poker guild management tools and gamified ICE Poker guild leagues will further incentivize guild owners to hold xDG and actively participate in Decentral Games governance. As owners of several ICE wearables, guild owners will make community decisions that directly impact their livelihood and solidify the long-term sustainability of the ICE Poker ecosystem in which they operate.\n\nA leaderboard with prizes accessible to delegated players who hold 100 xDG will incentivize delegated players to participate in Decentral Games governance and give the top 3 players the opportunity to graduate to player-ownership each month.

Today, we have ~1.9M DAI, ~$8M total across the ETH and MATIC DG LP Pairs, and $15.2M in DG in the 'DG Treasury.' \n\nProposal\n\nFor the following two drops that are priced in ETH, give the DG Team discretion to use the mint proceeds across the following 3 areas:\n\n(1) At least 50% to stable coin reserves;\n(2) Purchase DG, which goes into 'DG Treasury';\n(3) Add to ICE-USDC LP\n\nRationale\n\n(1) Most of the assets in the DAO (e.g. Matic, LAND) are highly-correlated with ETH and the broader crypto market. It makes sense to have a large hedge against a market down turn. Today, we have 1.9M DAI out of $57M in the Treasury, which is a relatively small percentage of the DAO's assets. \n\n(2) Based on the expectation that we will generate > $8.25M in revenue this month (> $100M annualized) and DG has a circulating market cap of ~$160M, we believe the token is significantly undervalued. Purchasing DG today for future use (e.g. distributions to xDG holders) is a good use of funds at this time.\n\n(3) There's some value to having the ability to add to this position as the circulating supply of ICE increases, as this would have the net effect of reducing volatility, but we don't necessarily need to add to the $7.5M position imminently.\n\nNote: If the vote is 'NO', the DAO would hold onto the ETH until another proposal were passed outlining the use of some\/all of the funds.","protocol":"decentralgames","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x3779a1a19705Df1FDF54D108ec3cfE03b9f8Ab8E","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":14163180,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/decentralgames.eth\/proposal\/0xc7964c8c79e4b6cb41464062cac4cd7fc23fcc21beb5882caea8d24017350763","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644256800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644602400}","startTimestamp":1644256800,"endTimestamp":1644602400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

As circulating supply increases, these figures would increase. \n\nProposal\n\n100K xDG to submit a proposal and 10M xDG to reach a quorum. \n\nRationale\n\nWe'd like to welcome in more participation from the ecosystem via this formal channel. Today, 33 people have enough xDG to submit a proposal. With this change, 185 people would be able to.

By further incentivizing ICE Poker player-owners (players who play with the wearables they own) to stack wearables, overall ICE emission will be reduced, improving the overall burn-to-earn ratio. \n\nFor example, if a player has 5 wearables, they are currently economically optimal by playing with 1 wearable and delegating the other 4 wearables, to 1 player each. This results in the player-owner earning a 1x ICE payout from playing and a 0.4x ICE payout from each of his delegated players \u2013 a 2.6x total ICE payout for the owner. In this scenario, due to the players each earning a 0.6x ICE payout, the total ICE emission corresponding to these 5 wearables is 2.6x + 0.6x + 0.6x + 0.6x + 0.6x = 5x. \n\nWith the proposed new bonus structure, the player-owner would be incentivized to play with all 5 wearables instead of delegating them, which would yield a 3x ICE earnings for the player-owner, and a 3x total ICE emission for these 5 wearables instead of 5x.

Additionally, the jump from being a delegated player to an ICE Poker NFT owner is from 70% to 100% of the payout, which is only a 42.9% increase in rewards.\n\n\n**Proposal**\n\nUpdate the ICE Poker NFT Player\/Delegator split to: \n\nRank 1: 60 \/ 40\nRank 2: 57 \/ 43\nRank 3: 54 \/ 46\nRank 4: 51 \/ 49\nDiamond Hands: 48 \/ 52\n\n***Note: If a delegated player is playing with 2 or more delegated wearables, then the split would be based on the highest ranked wearable.***\n\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe rationale for increasing the split by level is to further incentivize owners to burn ICE to upgrade wearables. Consider today \u2013 a Level 5 wearable has ~36% higher expected earnings than a Level 1. With these proposed changes, expected earnings would be ~77% higher (based on (0.52\/0.4)*1.36). 70% of the incremental value from upgrading an NFT accrues to the delegated player; the NFT owner is bearing the expense of upgrading the item, and it makes sense for more of the incremental ICE earnings to accrue mostly to the owner. This new tiered system accrues most of the increased bonus to the owner yet still gives upside to the player for them to want to play with higher ranked wearables.\n\nThe rationale for increasing the baseline delegator split from 30% to 40% is to further incentivize player ownership. Player ownership and upward mobility (getting your own wearable and then delegating them to build your own guild) are essential for ICE ecosystem sustainability. And at the current split, the jump from earning 70% as a delegated player to earning 100% playing with your own item (42.9% increase in rewards) is not large enough of a jump for many to justify purchasing their own wearable. With the proposed 60% rewards as a delegated player to 100% playing with your own item (66.7% increase in rewards), purchasing your own wearable is a much more attractive proposition. \n\nFurthermore, wearables owners are more inclined to reinvest their earnings back into items (upgrading or buying new ones) at a higher rate. Ecosystem long-term sustainability is paramount and will ultimately result in better payouts for everyone over a longer time horizon.

The 425 ETH was all converted to USDC and used to add the the DG DAO's USDC-ICE LP position which now sits at ~$6.3M. We expect to do 2 more drops this month. \n\nProposal\n\nFor the following two drops, give the DG Team discretion to use the mint proceeds across the following 4 areas: \n\n-- ICE-USDC LP\n-- Buying Back ICE in order to burn it\n-- Providing New DG - ETH LP on UniSwap\n-- Providing New DG - Matic LP on QuickSwap\n\nRationale\n\nSince the ICE Burned\/Earned ratio of 0.6 is less than 1, we do need to use some revenue to buyback and support the price of ICE. Axie and other p2e ecosystems sustain at far lower ratios than 0.6, and this level is very sustainable as only a fraction of revenue will be used for buybacks. As we buyback, we don't want the DAO to be front-run and it's useful to have some discretion to react to market conditions regarding exactly how much to buyback. The majority of the funds would still be used to provide liquidity. \n\nPrior to token split, we incentivized Old DG-ETH LP with DG rewards and had ~$7M in LP in that pair. Today, we have ~$3.2M in New DG-ETH LP and ~$2.6M in Old DG-ETH LP. We expect the Old DG LP to trend toward 0 as holders migrate to New DG. In order for new buyers and indexes to make large DEX transactions, we view > $5M in New DG-ETH LP as a target level. We might also want to add some liquidity to New DG on QuickSwap since there is only $0.6M there. Of the 4 sections, New DG-Matic LP is the least urgent so additions pending available funds. \n\nFinally, this proposal restricts the discretion to 2 drops so that the community can weigh in on the Team's decisions here and we can revisit how we want to handle future drops as a DAO. \n\nLinks\n\nUniSwap New DG-ETH LP: https:\/\/v2.info.uniswap.org\/pair\/0x3df70e5b6edead5277590d3de5731d17f46e043b\n\nUniSwap Old DG-ETH LP: \nhttps:\/\/v2.info.uniswap.org\/pair\/0x44c21f5dcb285d92320ae345c92e8b6204be8cdf\n\nQuickSwap New DG-Matic LP: https:\/\/info.quickswap.exchange\/pair\/0x71bd159cf9136d038a60f10118741dfcb10c3111\n\nQuickSwap ICE-USDC LP:\nhttps:\/\/info.quickswap.exchange\/pair\/0x9e3880647c07ba13e65663de29783ecd96ec21de","protocol":"decentralgames","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xb3Ab3a2f58a7d91Fe3Dcf9ABAd53C0dD1603B847","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13772548,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/decentralgames.eth\/proposal\/0x6d795d45a00ed07be96897fbf1b7bc63b18f6397097ab2111ead8bc8fbfc1b73","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639072800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639504800}","startTimestamp":1639072800,"endTimestamp":1639504800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES - Discretion for 2 drops', 'No - Use all for ICE-USDC LP', 'No - Only ICE LP or ICE Buyback']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

Another alternative would have been to incentivize LP directly via DG emission (rewards), but this is not a good use of DG given we can afford to supply the LP ourselves.

The Ops team is not a top-down control structure, but exists to help and support our guilds and members.\n\n## Why an Ops team:\n\n- Large operational DAO challenges were previously the responsibility of individual guilds, or the founding team, or unaccounted for, and bringing them together allows us to move forward effectively without confusion and diffusion of responsibility. Many processes are currently blocked, and formalizing the Ops team will help us get unblocked.\n\n## Purpose of the operations team:\n\n- Support and enable members and contributors to successfully execute on Developer DAO\u2019s mission by putting in place and maintaining operational systems and structures.\nResponsibilities of the operations team:\n\n- Coordinate to harmonize initiatives and reduce duplicated efforts across DAO guilds. ( e.g. Onboarding efforts, tooling setup, comms announcements, etc. )\n\n- Actively maintaining context across the DAO by having an Ops team member attend guild weekly calls and liaise with guild leaders.\n\n- Coordinating guilds to find, focus, and execute on specific season and period priorities.\n\n- Helping to tame and manage common DAO infrastructure, like the governance forum (getting sign-in-with-ethereum and restricting posting to DAO members) and the Discord server (streamlining the Discord server experience will not be simple or quick or easy!) Notion, bots, calendars, etc.\n\n- DAO onboarding and offboarding policies and procedures, including empowering people to take on suitable roles within the DAO. This is going to be a HUGE effort and critical to our success as we open the floodgates to new members.\n\n- Legal and accounting policies and procedures, and owning relationships with compliance professionals working on behalf of the DAO (Accountants, Lawyers, etc). This includes defining budgets processes, contributor rewards, and treasury management and putting appropriate plans through our community governance process.\n\n- Safeguarding DAO and member capacity to prioritize execution and prevent burnout. ( eg scheduling 1-on-1 priority and cadence setting calls with contributors, coordinating guilds around DAO season priorities, recruiting for underserved teams, etc. )\n\n## Current state of the operations team:\n\n[Kempsterrr](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kempsterrrr) and [RyanCoordinator](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryancoordinator) have been working full-time in operations roles for the DAO and will be the first co-leads of the official D_D Ops team. The DAO and its operational needs are under active development and evolution. Many roles and teams will need to be started and nurtured in order to execute on Ops team responsibilities, and the landscape will change drastically as the DAO grows through Season 1. This plan for the Ops team takes on and makes explicit the tasks and responsibilities the original core team has been taking on by default, and the formal creation of this Ops team follows our ratified Season 0 roadmap. The Ops team expects to issue a revised scope and plan at the beginning of D_D Season 2 to report to the community and refine our operational posture. We will also be in constant contact with our members to ensure their needs are being met.\n\nDeveloper DAO has been working with our partner Gitcoin to advance the structure of our DAO and they have committed $GTC for the purpose of setting foundations, funding our operations, and retaining operational staff. We will be following through with this while we work towards the release of D_D\u2019s $CODE governance token and $CODE denominated budgets for guilds and initiatives.\n\nThe process of evolving the DAO structure includes redefining the role of the \u2018core team\u2019, from now on referred to as the \u2018founding team\u2019, and the official establishment of the Ops team is an important step towards delegating previous founding team duties to official DAO organs. The founding team will not be leaving us, and continue to be vitally important members of our community, and will not be abandoning their responsibilities as signers on the treasury mutli-sig. Having a strong equality between guild leaders and founding team is a limiting factor to the growth of our guilds and community that we are now outgrowing and moving beyond.\n\n## In summary:\n\nFollowing through on Developer DAO\u2019s Season 0 roadmap and setting us up for success requires a dedicated full-time operations staff with an explicit mandate. Please vote to YES to formally recognize and empower our already working full-time staff, and support them so they can support our DAO.

With an explosion in growth, the DAO needs to further decentralize. The creation of a governance token will help the DAO expand its operations and membership through a diversified community treasury.\n\nThe token - $CODE - will provide the governing power to accomplish these goals, done by distributing tokens to existing members. A treasury will be established for future partnerships and contributions while governance will accrue to members that contribute to the future successes of Developer DAO.\n\nThe decision to create a new governance token comes as an expansion upon the Genesis NFT - Devs for Revolution. While these NFTs will be used for early voting, it does not solve for partnerships, future memberships, and future contributors. Therefore, $CODE will become the primary governance token for Developer DAO moving forward.\n\n$CODE is an ERC-20 token on mainnet Ethereum using audited and battle-tested smart contracts open-sourced by OpenZeppelin. $CODE is a non-financial governance token.\n\n## Token Distribution\n\n### Token Distribution\nThere will be 10,000,000 initial $CODE tokens.\n\n50% to the Developer DAO Treasury\n25% to current members\n10% to founding team and advisors*\n10% to early contributors\n5% to partners\n\\* subject to vesting\n\nAdditional $CODE tokens can be minted through the governance process. This option provides protection for the DAO. Additional minting of $CODE tokens can also be fully disabled in the smart contract through the governance process.\n\n### Developer DAO Treasury\n\nThe Developer DAO Treasury - found at 0x7128f5ff32eD07Ce12E6a9deBE32BB40F9884b3C - will receive 50% of $CODE tokens. The treasury will be governed by $CODE holders and exists to further the mission of the DAO to onboard web3 developers.\n\nTokens held in the DAO treasury will not be used for governance. Distributions from the Treasury will only come from additional proposals that pass the full governance voting process.\n\n### CODEdrop - Current Members\n\nCurrent Members of the Developer DAO will receive 25% of $CODE tokens via a retroactive airdrop. Current Members are defined as any genesis NFT holder at block #13612670 83. Using a snapshot of members at this time helps counter Sybil attacks leading to unwanted members receiving a large amount of governing power.\n\n$CODE will be distributed to members as follows:\n\n**Distribution Equation:**\nMember allocation = 400 (NFT) + 359 (pre-season 0 POAP or pre-season 0 snapshot vote)*\n\n\\* note: the final numbers will be determined by each snapshot NFT holder receiving 400 tokens and then dividing the remaining current members allocation amount by the number of accounts eligible for the POAP\/Vote bonus.\n\nEvery member will receive 400 tokens for holding the NFT at the time of the snapshot. At the start of Season 1 (TBD), 400 $CODE tokens will give membership access to the DAO. If a member holds a POAP from our Developer DAO town halls before Season 0 OR voted on either of our first two snapshot proposals, they will receive an additional 359* tokens. A member can receive up to 759* tokens through the airdrop alone.\n\nMembers will receive governance tokens through a claim process. Token claims will be available for six months, after which the Developer DAO can retrieve unclaimed tokens to be added to the Treasury.\n\n### Founding Team & Advisors\n\nThe Founding Team (6 members) and Advisors (2 members) will receive 10% of $CODE tokens. The Founding Team will retain 6%, current Advisors will retain 0.9%, and 3.1% will be set aside for future allocation.\n\n50% of the Founder Team & Advisors allocation will vest at token issuance with 50% of the tokens subject to a 2 year vesting period. Distributions will happen monthly. Vested tokens can be used as governing power, while unvested tokens cannot.\n\nIt is essential for the DAO to have committed members helping lead and structure DAO operations and governance. Incentivizing these members is key to this goal. The lockup and vesting periods ensure that governing power starts in the hands of the DAO members and stays there.\n\n### Early Contributors\n\nEarly Contributors will receive 10% of $CODE tokens in addition to the airdrop. It is important we recognize early contributions made to the DAO before fanfare and a reward mechanism was in place. The 10% of $CODE tokens will be allocated by DAO members using Coordinape after this proposal passes. Founding Team & Advisors will not be eligible for these rewards.\n\n### Partners\n\nGitcoin will receive 5% of the token. Gitcoin has been identified as a perfect partner for Developer DAO with aligned missions and values. By partaking in a governance token swap, we receive governing power of the Gitcoin DAO.\n\nThe Gitcoin partnership, to be passed in a separate governance vote, allocated 50,000 GTC to the Developer DAO treasury in exchange for 5% of the $CODE supply.\n\n## Governance Tokens & Distribution Advice\n\nTo draft our governance token proposal and formulate the token distribution, industry standards and leading advisors were consulted.\n\n### Cooper Turley\n\nAn early advocate for DAOs, Cooper has been an important contributor and advisor to a number of Governance Token launches including Gitcoin and ENS. Cooper has worked closely with the Developer DAO team to present the structure and rollout of this proposal and the $CODE token.\n\n### Preethi Kasireddy\n\nPreethi is an experienced teacher, founder, engineer, investor, and banker who has built smart contracts for various crypto projects.

The purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Developer DAO can work together to coordinate bringing more web2 developers into web3 than ever before through education and events, as well as supporting the creation and distribution of public goods.\n\n## Motivation\nDeveloper DAO\u2019s mission is to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders.\n\nFor our community to thrive, realise its potential and deliver on this mission, we need to lay the right foundations for growth and have the resources to bootstrap operations and retain a team where needed. Forming partnerships with other DAOs who have a well aligned mission and have been on this journey before will help us tackle these challenges faster than we otherwise would be able to.\n\nGitcoin\u2019s mission is to build & fund the open web. Their innovations in Quadratic Funding have resulted in funding for over 1,900 open source projects to the tune of ~ $40m and around 300,000 developers actively use their public goods each month to learn, earn, connect and fund what they are doing.\n\nThese achievements and ambitions resonate extremely well with ours, and Gitcoin\u2019s substantial experience establishing and growing a DAO are invaluable to us as we embark on a similar journey.\n\nWe see this relationship complementing Developer DAO in the following ways:\n\n- Enabling even more developers to have a voice in the future direction of Gitcoin via allocation of their Governance token (GTC) into the Developer DAO treasury.\n- Strengthen ties between and improve the shared bandwidth of Gitcoin and Developer DAO teams (Moonshot Coordinator, Austin Griffth, Nader Dabit, Cooper Turley, Preethi Kasireddy, kempsterrrr).\n- Collaborating on workshops, events and hackathons with Austrin Griffith and the Moonshot Collective workstream, to further the reach and impact of Gitcoin\u2019s public goods efforts.\n- Co-creating prototypes between Moonshot + Developer DAO that play well with the Loot ecosystem vibes \/ memes.\n\n## Specification\nThe passing of this proposal would transfer 50,000 GTC to 0x7128f5ff32eD07Ce12E6a9deBE32BB40F9884b3C, Developer DAO\u2019s specified Treasury address.\n\nOn the launch of Developer DAO\u2019s governance token, a 5% allocation would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin\u2019s multisig address for easier delegation \/ voting.\n\nUse of Funds\n\nTo ensure long term alignment, Developer DAO will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.\n\nTo ensure long term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Developer DAO ecosystem.\n\n## Benefits\nSee \u201cMotivation\u201d section above\n\n## Drawbacks\n5% of our Governance token will be issued to Gitcoin at launch.\n\n## Prior Discussion & Forum Vote\nPlease see prior discussion and our forum vote [here](https:\/\/forum.developerdao.com\/t\/p4-partnership-mutual-grant-with-gitcoin\/548).\n\n## Vote\nVote `For` to support the partnership & mutual grant.

The core team being initially staffed by Guild \u201cLeaders\u201d. Projects are worked on by pulling resources from guilds.\n\nFor Season 0 we have a proposed 6 Guilds and Leaders (below) based on existing contributions to the DAO.

We are getting attention from almost every big-shot in the industry & there are folks selling their BAYC\/punks to go all-in to Doodles. We account success of Doodles to all the right ingredients in right proportion ranging from art, team to community.  \n\nBeing leaders in NFT space, there also comes a moral & social responsibility. We are aware of critics, every now & then, criticising blockchains due to their environmental impact by carbon emissions and Greenhouse gases. We generally turn deaf ears to their arguments or counter it by stating how blockchain is gonna change the world economy as a whole. \n\nHowever, bitter truth is, the problem is real and grave. To give you a rough idea, every successful transaction on Ethereum blockchain emits ~100kg of carbon in the environment & electricity consumed by it could have powered a US household for 8 days ( https:\/\/digiconomist.net\/ethereum-energy-consumption ). There are proposals for a brighter future with POS and other optimisations but a lot of emissions have been done already and \u2018A LOT\u2019 are yet to be done. If we look at solely our project, we have emitted ~3000 tonnes of Carbon in the environment so far. \nTo counter the environmental impact, the least we can do at this stage is to nullify carbon emissions by promoting carbon preserving projects (renewable energy, solar, bio-mass etc)  & afforestation. \n\nVCS (voluntary carbon standard) is one such mechanism to achieve it. Almost every big company\/MNC emitting carbon nullifies the impact by retiring equivalent VCS in the carbon registries ( http:\/\/www.perillon.com\/blog\/12-companies-that-are-buying-carbon-offsets) . We can start doing similar activities as part of BSR (Blockchain Social Responsibility I call it) for on-chain projects.\n \nPrima-facie, the responsibility to make particular project\/smart contract green lies with project\u2019s founders and communities.  Doodles community can setup a benchmark in the industry by becoming first GREEN project on Ethereum blockchain. \n\nHow can we achieve that?\nThere are certain carbon credit tokens already trading on-chain which can be utilised to achieve the same. Doing it in a decentralised first manner, we need to create a smart contract which takes input of these carbon credits and \u2018burns\u2019 them against particular project (Doodle in our case). Also, creating dashboards on top of that will help us in tracking emissions, green % and other metrics for projects. \n\nSo here I\u2019m doing my bit for environment preservation and proposing to take pledge (not any money) from community if I should work on this and if Doodle community is gonna support to become 1st GREEN PROJECT by nullifying the carbon emissions?\n\nWanna discuss more? Hit me up @cryptonoob#4807\n\nThanks for reading through all of this. More power to Doodlers!\n","protocol":"doodles","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x866AAA9C00e376bE14B47064e24B647a5Bccc717","totalVotes":45,"blockNumber":13990148,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/doodles.eth\/proposal\/0x7ed85045818a92f6cfdc807f7731e540f9c51e69de721ed66a8b548ef0973f74","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641987546}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642246746}","startTimestamp":1641987546,"endTimestamp":1642246746,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['I pledge and support', 'Not for now']","results":"[{'total': 44, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 42, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Thanks everyone!

Inspired by Tyler Hobbs\u2019 article about Flow Field and Fidenza, he decided to play with those concepts and combine them with the Doodles color palette to create a really cool generative art piece called \u201cRainbow Puke over the Flow Field,\u201d now lovingly known as \u201cPukenza.\u201d The original proposal for Pukenza was so popular and received so much support that we passed the preliminary Snapshot with flying pukey colors! Since then, Lim has continued to work hard at developing the art, refining the outputs, and doing all the little technical things that need to be done in order for us to all be able to receive our beautiful Pukenzas!\n\nWhy Pukenza?\nThis art is awesome and it would be a nice little treat to Doodle holders whilst rewarding an artist that is deeply involved with the Doodles community!\n\nHow will this be delivered?\n@L3xc and @WestCoastNFT will deliver the Pukenza via https:\/\/degenartclub.com\/\n\nWen Pukenza mint:\n4-6 Weeks\n\nThis time will allow for:\n- Polishing the algorithm for the generative art\n- Testing outputs\n- Smart contract + website preparation\n\nYou can find frequent updates on the project in Lim's Degen Art Club Discord server: https:\/\/discord.gg\/csh7FGjcMm\n\nDid you vote on the preliminary snapshot?

All contributions of $500 or more to the Foundation Fund, in the form of USDC, ETH or DRC, will be rewarded with a GEN01 NFT.\n\n-----\nProposal\n\nA digital printing company in Benue State, Nigeria, is looking to auction off the company, rights to its premises and the associated printing equipment.\n\nThe total cost of this opportunity is $6000. The DRC Foundation proposes a grant of $3000 to be transferred in WETH from the DRC Foundation Fund to Mr. Okwori\u2019s personal Ethereum address, where he can then withdraw and utilise the funds for the above opportunity.\n\nThe DRC Foundation will also encourage community members to donate to fulfill the full $6000 requirement; an additional $3000 target for donations will be set. Community members that donate a minimum of $500, in the form of USDC, ETH or DRC to the DRC Foundation Fund will also receive a GEN01 NFT.\n\n-----\nRationale\n\nMr Okwori is a long-time supporter of DRC through his role as lead admin in the DRC Africa community. Thanks to his regular and positive contributions to the community space, and his on-the-ground efforts for DRC, including holding digital asset seminars in his local area and creating DRC-themed t-shirts and graphics, Mr. Okwori has shown himself to be one of DRC\u2019s most trusted contributors.\n\nAs Mr. Okwori\u2019s profession is within the digital media space, this opportunity aligns well to his skills and connections. He can use the facilities to contribute to the outreach campaign in Nigeria and Africa proper.\n\nThe DRC Foundation would like to extend this offer to Mr. Okwori based on the quality of the business opportunity, and the offer is bolstered by the understanding of Mr. Okwori\u2019s character and desire to progress DRC in his region of Nigeria. A grant such as this is not an investment in a business, but in a staunch believer and humble supporter of DRC.\n\nThe opportunity also allows the DRC community to demonstrate its ethos of a project built by the community, for the community.\n\nThis proposal will be voted on by the DRC community via a Snapshot governance vote. If passed, the DRC Foundation Fund will begin the transfer to Mr. Okwori. Mr. Okwori will commit to regular updates of both his involvement in the business, his efforts to utilise the printing business for the benefit of DRC, and also the financial performance of the printing business.\n\n----- \nBelow is a link to a .pdf file that contains the full proposal from the DRC Foundation, Mr. Okwori's original proposal, a breakdown of the costing and equipment, and a series of photographs of the premises. \n\nhttps:\/\/bafybeidgu2cbgco3nd5t2bam7qr5b7l6itmf2wzu3he75njuaz3nid4djy.ipfs.dweb.link\/\n-----","protocol":"drc","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x2dbC5e8f6a2eAADd01c044CBA36764d6536866b5","totalVotes":20,"blockNumber":13042154,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/drctoken.eth\/proposal\/QmYuYjJzBnzVZCt2pWxBksJxk9Urdf251uCcLgVWB9wQBQ","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1629198000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1629565200}","startTimestamp":1629198000,"endTimestamp":1629565200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - agree with the grant', 'No - reject the grant', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 40106800, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 6771223, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

If they move then the Vaults may experience liquidity issues. Further, there are unclear regulatory guidelines for DeFi investment protocols at present and this may present a challenge for DRC\u2019s compliance.\n\n2) The s2 Vault contains highly liquid assets only and is a hedging allocation set, not an investment proposal. The additions of BTC and ETH are to help offset inflationary forces. The s2 Vault provdes great utility for DRC users that may want to hedge the market conditions.\n\n3a) The DRC Vault is solely a visible storage Vault, and alone produces no rewards for holders. The initiative proposed both rewards the DRC supporters and also drives forward the community structure that is the focus for this quarter.\n\n3b) These criteria are proposed to drive value into the DRC market and to ensure that only committed holders are eligible for rewards.","protocol":"drc","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x2dbC5e8f6a2eAADd01c044CBA36764d6536866b5","totalVotes":19,"blockNumber":12697613,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/drctoken.eth\/proposal\/QmWv1mMcdFyzi9zsknVPBbQGMd7j2uTezZbHwxSDSGe5z6","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1624532400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1625050800}","startTimestamp":1624532400,"endTimestamp":1625050800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - agree with changes', 'No - disagree with changes']","results":"[{'total': 25752752, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

We must now decide how to best utilise these funds.\n\nAs per the Liquidity Provision Incentive released in November, those that have been providing liquidity for DRC-ETH on Uniswap will receive their pro-rata share of the accumulated fees since the time of Genesis.\n\nThe next steps are more open for the DRC Community.\n\nConsiderations:\n- The LP unlock is currently ~$800k \n- The DR Vaults require strong liquidity pools to function correctly\n- Uniswap is still the most popular AMM in the market\n- Potential uses for the funds\n- Uniswap v3 is around the corner.\n\nThe Proposal\n- Redistribute the accumulated fees according to the Liquidity Provision Incentive program\n- Provide ~$150k to Quickswap in the form of a DRC\/MATIC pool \n[Currently, there are some pools on Quickswap but are extremely shallow. If we are to create this pool, we can also benefit from synergistic marketing with Quickswap\u2019s team]\n- The remaining Genesis LP is transferred to the DRC Foundation Multisig wallet\n- Relock the remaining funds for 1 month to allow for the release of Uniswap v3, and reassess the best options forward for DRC after this.\n\nCaveats:\n- For the Quickswap Liquidity transfer, there is no viable technical solution to do this without a person manually transferring. The Foundation proposes the Josh (CC) can set up a live stream of the transfer. The process would be to receive the allocated funds (ETH and DRC), bridge to Polygon via the Matic Bridge, trade the ETH for MATIC, and create the genesis pool for DRC\/MATIC. Currently there is no Gnosis safe available on Polygon, but it is in the works. Until that point, the LP will remain in the wallet featured in the live stream.\n- The LP fees redistribution will be in the form of the Uni v2 DRC\/ETH LP token, transferred to the qualifying 52 addresses that have provided liquidity until this point. The transfer will be performed by the DR Vaults Developer Wallet.\n\nNotes: \n- For the health of the ecosystem, it is extremely important that DRC community members continue to provide liqudity on Uniswap, and increase their LP holdings if possible.\n- Those on Quickswap already providing liquidity please continue to do so until the DRC\/MATIC pool is released.","protocol":"drc","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x2dbC5e8f6a2eAADd01c044CBA36764d6536866b5","totalVotes":34,"blockNumber":12371912,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/drctoken.eth\/proposal\/QmY4RWyaZSzkzn5YDZEtEHXiJN6CxBpQxoY8qqggnJDyq1","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1620187200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1620316800}","startTimestamp":1620187200,"endTimestamp":1620316800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Agree with the proposal', 'Disagree with the proposal']","results":"[{'total': 225770540, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2998947, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

{"refId":"cHJvcG9zYWw6ZHlkeDpkZWZhdWx0OjU=","id":"5","title":"dYdX Grants Program","content":"\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nLaunch the dYdX Grants Program with $6.25m moved from the Community Treasury to the Grants Multi-sig.\n\n## Abstract\n\nReverie is proposing to lead a Grants program for the dYdX community to engage participants and attract new contributors. Grants will include both small and large projects with grantees ranging from single individuals to institutional teams. A Grants Committee, specified in the DRC, will control the multi-sig and\nadvise the lead team on grants. A list of initial RFP ideas has been published on the website with the hopes of inspiring future contributors. Applicants are\nencouraged to apply for existing RFPs or propose new Grant projects. The lead team will review all applications and submit funding proposals to the Committee.\n\nThe snapshot vote concluded with 314 voters and 18M DYDX in agreement (98.9%). The vote results have shown significant support for the program.\nhttps:\/\/forums.dydx.community\/snapshot\/dydxgov.eth\/0xe77513bfec9f55b1d620d973af1c4da1266ceffd333cbb120bc54a9359d27a40\n\n**Relevant Links**\n\nDGP website: https:\/\/dydxgrants.com\/\n\nDRC discussion: https:\/\/forums.dydx.community\/proposal\/discussion\/2511-drc-dydx-grants-program\/\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe goal of the program is to increase the contributor count and actively promote the growth of the dYdX protocol. While initial grants cannot directly change\nthe dYdX product or core development, Grantees will have the opportunity to impact growth through external tools and non-technical projects (e.g. Analytics dashboards, newsletters, governance etc..). This contributor growth will lead to improvements across both user experiences and the overall community.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Program Design**\n\n* $3m DYDX Funding per quarter for two quarters\n* 1 Full Time Lead\n* 8 Committee Members\n* Committee Member held Multi-Sig\n\nThe treasury will move $6.25m worth of DYDX to the Committee Member multi-sig.\n\nFunds will be used to reward Grantees, pay the Lead and cover additional program costs. Grantees will be subject to milestones that can determine compensation structure, with standard payouts being 25% upfront and the remainder upon completion.\n\n**DYDX Amount**\n\nThe amount of DYDX to be moved from the community treasury to the DGP Multisig will be determined using a 24h vwap of the trades executed on the most liquid exchange, namely Binance.com. Given it makes up roughly 30% of the 24h volume, the DYDX\/USDT Binance market data will be used to derive a market price. The data will be pulled from https:\/\/data.binance.vision\/?prefix=data\/spot\/daily\/trades\/DYDXUSDT\/. The previous day's trades will be used to capture a full 24h window so as to avoid timing constraints. As such, we will use the following data set: https:\/\/data.binance.vision\/data\/spot\/daily\/trades\/DYDXUSDT\/DYDXUSDT-trades-2022-01-01.zip.\n\nThis formula will be used to calculate the price: \u03a3(Price * Volume) \/ \u03a3(Volume).\n\nFrom the data above, we find: $16,199,143.30 \/ 1,949,010.42 = $8.31.\n\nThe DYDX Amount to be transferred will be $6,250,000 \/ $8.31 = **752000.00** (rounded up to the nearest thousand for simplicity).\n\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe community has addressed certain concerns and issues with a Grants program in the DRC, but overall consensus has been in strong support of launching. The program will make productive use of treasury funds to promote the protocol and engage contributors.

{"refId":"cHJvcG9zYWw6ZHlkeDpkZWZhdWx0OjQ=","id":"4","title":"Upgrade the StarkProxy smart contract","content":"\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nUpgrade StarkProxy smart contracts to support deposit cancellation and recovery.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWhen depositing USDC to the dYdX Layer 2 exchange, the funds are held in a bridge contract while waiting for the deposit to be processed by the L2 sequencer and prover. While funds are on the bridge awaiting confirmation, the depositor can initiate a time-locked recovery process to cancel the deposit. This functionality is not currently supported by the Stark Proxy smart contracts which manage the funds borrowed by market makers from the Liquidity Module staking pool. These Stark Proxy smart contracts should be upgraded to support deposit cancelation and recovery.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOn October 27, 2021 09:37:37 AM +UTC, we (Wintermute) borrowed 50 million USDC (transaction [here](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0xa9cc82d4d8e6360538bb3c61e91a6c2494d98d7644d4516b0456a8008dad0e47)) from the [Liquidity Staking Pool](https:\/\/docs.dydx.community\/dydx-governance\/staking-pools\/liquidity-staking-pool) and attempted to deposit the funds to our trading account on the dYdX exchange. We had to send deposit programmatically because the client provided by the dYdX Foundation team does not support wallet-connect yet. Unfortunately, the wrong \u201cvaultId\u201d parameter was passed in the call to \u201cdepositToExchange\u201d (transaction [here](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0xe6a1130a56abf62a076ef4210a28da20e06226295b54fc52b89a6b61850dca8e)). Because this \u201cvaultId\u201d did not correspond to our STARK key, the deposit was invalid and could not be confirmed on L2.\nThe 50M USDC are safely held by the dYdX L2 exchange smart contract and can be reclaimed by the StarkProxy contract. However, to reclaim the funds, the StarkProxy contract must call \u201cdepositCancel\u201d and \u201cdepositReclaim\u201d on the L2 exchange smart contract. \nUpgrading these smart contracts would allow us to recover the 50M USDC and ensure that other market makers can safely make use of the Liquidity Staking Pool.\n\nFollowing a forum DRC [thread](https:\/\/forums.dydx.community\/proposal\/discussion\/2437-drc-smart-contract-upgrade-for-market-maker-borrowers-from-liquidity-staking-pool\/), Wintermute launched a 5-day poll on Snapshot regarding the question of Stark Proxy upgrade. The results of the poll are available [here](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/dydxgov.eth\/proposal\/0x3d62d5b77b2b9bd3ab1c42c296cc36ccf89f77bea22815081e785d5d28d32366). The Snapshot vote has concluded with 5.3M DYDX (99.92%) from 474 voters indicating consensus in favor of the DRC. \n\n## Specification\n\nWhen market makers borrow funds from the Liquidity Module staking pool they must do so via a StarkProxy smart contract which manages the funds and limits how they may be used. The StarkProxy borrows funds from the pool using a \u201cborrow\u201d call and then deposits those to the exchange using \u201cdepositToExchange\u201d providing multiple parameters in transaction data describing which account should be credited. This deposit transaction transfers funds to the dYdX L2 exchange smart contract ([here](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xd54f502e184b6b739d7d27a6410a67dc462d69c8)) and, if a deposit is valid, it is submitted and confirmed on L2. If the deposit parameters are misspecified by the caller, it may not be possible to credit the deposit. In such a case, as long as the \u201cstarkKey\u201d was correctly specified in the deposit, the depositor can reclaim their funds using the \u201cdepositCancel\u201d and \u201cdepositReclaim\u201d functions. This process is described [here](https:\/\/docs.starkware.co\/starkex-v3\/starkex-deep-dive\/smart-contracts-1\/public-interactions#deposit).\nSince \u201cdepositCancel\u201d and \u201cdepositReclaim\u201d are not currently implemented on the StarkProxy contract, it is not possible for those contracts to reclaim funds in the case where a deposit transaction is malformed and unable to be processed. \nCurrently there is one such invalid deposit of 50M USDC which must be canceled in order for the funds to be recovered and put to use. The deposit is invalid because the wrong vault number was used, and the vault number and stark key specified in the deposit transaction do not match.\n  \n**Implementation**\n\nUpgraded Stark Proxy implementation [Stark Proxy V2](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/blob\/master\/contracts\/stark-proxy\/README.md) is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation governance contracts repository.\n\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nTest cases for Stark Proxy have been extended to cover new V2 functions. It is open-sourced in the dYdX Foundation [Stark Proxy tests](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/tree\/master\/test\/stark-proxy) folder. The deposit and cancelation process was thoroughly tested in both test and mainnet fork environments.\n\n[Detailed instructions](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/blob\/master\/contracts\/stark-proxy\/README.md) are provided on GitHub to allow anybody to run the same tests.\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).\n","protocol":"dydx","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xB11163E563bf02C120F58492F9F2f25FB30051A2","totalVotes":182,"blockNumber":13634890,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13634890}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13661170}","startTimestamp":1637177779,"endTimestamp":1637538698,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['NAY', 'YAE']","results":"[{'total': 69606504, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13678600}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1637776142}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13665365}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1637596087}]"}

Upgrade the Safety Module to use the new implementation contract.\n    2. Run the initializer function.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDifferent approaches were considered as to how to handle the funds that had already been staked. The \u201cclean slate\u201d approach of resetting the Safety Module is recommended as we believe it is the simplest and safest solution from a technical perspective.\n\nReaching community consensus and implementing a quick solution will allow recovery of the locked funds, and allow everyone access to the Safety Module staking pool. The Safety Module adds an important, additional safeguard to the protocol. It should be noted that Safety Module contract upgrades must use the long timelock, which imposes a minimum 18 day period (~1 day voting delay, 10 days voting duration, and 7 day timelock) between when a proposal is created and when it takes effect. In addition, long timelock proposals require a minimum quorum of 100 million DYDX (10% of the total supply) in order to pass. This means any solution will require broad community support as well as governance participation from dYdX investor token holders. For these reasons, it is imperative that the community approve this DIP in its simplest form as soon as possible.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nThe Safety Module has a full suite of [unit tests](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/tree\/master\/test\/safety-module) providing 100% code coverage. The proposed fix was simulated in both a local and forked mainnet environment.

The results of the poll are available [here](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/dydxgov.eth\/proposal\/QmbJ5QxHr1pyShKTDaF5DjAr6vxQn8DVxshH2fyWgzDCBn). In aggregate, 575 DYDX token holders and delegates voted with 17,112,789 DYDX. With 413 voters and 16,682,487.634 DYDX (97.4855% of total) in agreement, there was an overwhelming consensus that stakers should receive 10% of their staked DYDX to make them whole.\n\n**Specification**\n\nUsers affected by the Safety Module outage will receive funds via a Recovery Contract. The same contract that was deployed as part of the DIP-1 implementation will be used.\n\n***Reimbursement***\n\nThere are currently ~157,459 DYDX staked to the Safety Pool from 56 unique stakers. These funds are recoverable by governance via the long timelock.\n\nThis DIP specifies that action be taken via the **short timelock** to withdraw the same amount of DYDX from the Rewards Treasury to fund the Recovery Contract. This allows the stakers to get their funds back sooner.\n\n***Additional Reimbursement***\n\nThose 56 stakers who were affected by the bug will receive an additional 15,746 DYDX, pro-rata, to make them whole. This will be paid out from the Rewards Treasury, and claimable by stakers through the same Recovery Contract.

In response, access to the Safety Module staking pool was temporarily removed from [dydx.community](https:\/\/dydx.community\/).\n\nFollowing the Safety Module outage, the dYdX Foundation released a detailed [incident report](https:\/\/dydx.foundation\/blog\/en\/outage-1) explaining the cause of the error, the impact to users, a proposed solution, and lessons learned.\n\nAfter robust discussion on the Forums, a community member launched a 5-day poll on Snapshot regarding one aspect of the fix: reimbursing stakers for rewards they did not receive due to the error. The results of the poll are available [here](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/dydxgov.eth\/proposal\/QmbJ5QxHr1pyShKTDaF5DjAr6vxQn8DVxshH2fyWgzDCBn). A minimum of 10K DYDX tokens was required to submit this off-chain proposal.\n\nIn aggregate, 575 DYDX token holders and delegates voted with 17,112,789 DYDX. With 413 voters and 16,682,487.634 DYDX (97.4855% of total) in agreement, there was an overwhelming consensus that stakers should receive 10% of their staked DYDX to make them whole.\n\n\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe Safety Module will be reset to a clean slate. Staking and earning of rewards will become active as soon as the fix is executed by governance. Users affected by the bug will receive funds via a separate Recovery Contract.\n\n***Reimbursement***\n\nThere are currently ~157,459 DYDX staked to the Safety Pool from 56 unique stakers. No staked funds were lost. Stakers will receive their funds via the Recovery Contract.\n\n***Additional Reimbursement***\n\nThose 56 stakers who were affected by the bug will receive an additional 15,746 DYDX, pro-rata, to make them whole. This will be paid out from the Rewards Treasury, and claimable by stakers through the same Recovery Contract. There will be no lockup on these funds.\n\nEach staker will need to call the claim() function directly on the Recovery Contract to receive their funds. They may then decide if they want to re-stake in the Safety Module.\n\n***Smart Contract Implementations:***\n\n\n\n1. The [Recovery Contract](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/blob\/master\/contracts\/safety\/v2\/helpers\/SM2Recovery.sol) will be deployed with a hardcoded mapping from address to DYDX token amount. This amount should include the amount that was staked by that address, plus the additional 10%.\n    1. As a precaution, this contract will be upgradeable via the [Short Timelock](https:\/\/docs.dydx.community\/dydx-governance\/voting-and-governance\/governance-parameters).\n2. The new [SafetyModuleV2](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/blob\/master\/contracts\/safety\/v2\/SafetyModuleV2.sol) implementation will be deployed with the following changes:\n    1. A new initializer function which:\n        1. Calls transfer() to send all held DYDX to the specified Recovery Contract address.\n        2. Calls transferFrom() to send the specified additional amount from the rewards treasury to the specified Recovery Contract address.\n        3. Restores functionality to the Safety Module by setting the correct exchange rate.\n        4. Deletes data set by the original initializer, which is now garbage due to the shift in the storage layout.\n    2. Updates DISTRIBUTION_END to account for the delayed start to the Safety Module rewards.\n    3. Updates getRevision() to return a value of 2.\n\nThe on-chain proposal to be approved by governance will include the following transaction to be executed via the [Long Timelock](https:\/\/docs.dydx.community\/dydx-governance\/voting-and-governance\/governance-parameters):\n\n\n\n* Call upgradeAndCall() on the Safety Module [Proxy Admin](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/blob\/master\/contracts\/dependencies\/open-zeppelin\/ProxyAdmin.sol) contract, to atomically perform the following:\n    1. Upgrade the Safety Module to use the new implementation contract.\n    2. Run the initializer function with the agreed amount and Recovery Contract address.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDifferent approaches were considered as to how to handle the funds that had already been staked. The \u201cclean slate\u201d approach of resetting the Safety Module is recommended as we believe it is the simplest and safest solution from a technical perspective.\n\nDiscussion on the forums has so far centered around two main issues:\n\n\n\n* **The need for the Safety Module fix to be passed as soon as possible:** Reaching community consensus and implementing a quick solution will allow affected addresses to recover their funds, and allow everyone to access the Safety staking pool. The Safety Module adds an additional safeguard to the protocol. It should be noted that Safety Module contract upgrades must use the long timelock, which imposes a minimum 18 day period (~1 day voting delay, 10 days voting duration, and 7 day timelock) between when a proposal is created and when it takes effect. In addition, long timelock proposals require a minimum quorum of 100 million DYDX (10% of the total supply) in order to pass. This means any solution will require broad community support as well as governance participation from dYdX investor token holders. For these reasons, it is imperative that the community approve this DIP in its simplest form as soon as possible.\n* **The amount to offer affected addresses to make them whole:** Staked DYDX tokens have been locked in the smart contract since September 7, and remain locked until a fix is implemented by governance. Given that the Staking Module only processes withdrawals on an epoch basis (every 28 days), the staked tokens would have been locked at a minimum for the remainder of the epoch. The community generally agreed that it was reasonable to make stakers whole due to this error. Consensus evolved around the need to repay stakers for the amount they reasonably could have expected to earn by staking over an epoch, plus some damages. 10% of the amount staked for each affected address is a reasonable and simple policy.\n\n**Test Cases**\n\nThe Safety Module has a full suite of [unit tests](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/tree\/master\/test\/safety-module) providing 100% code coverage. The proposed fix was simulated in both a local and forked mainnet environment. The test suite was then run, to ensure that full functionality will be restored, following the execution of the governance proposal on mainnet.\n\nIn addition to unit testing, thorough validation was performed on the mainnet state to ensure that we have a thorough and accurate understanding of both the current smart contract state on mainnet and the precise nature of the bug. This validation included checking all smart contract [state](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/blob\/master\/test\/safety-module\/state.spec.ts) and [logs](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/blob\/master\/test\/safety-module\/events.spec.ts), verification of the contract [bytecode](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/blob\/master\/test\/safety-module\/bytecode.spec.ts), and detailed analysis of [storage slots](https:\/\/github.com\/dydxfoundation\/governance-contracts\/blob\/master\/test\/safety-module\/storage-slots.spec.ts), including those that are not directly accessible by the contract.

In reality, it was just the opposite, with 1Earth up by 70x.\n\nOur team is working closely with the KuCoin team on possible joint solutions to address the impact of the technical issues from the initial launch. However, before we proceed, we need to proactively make sure that there will be no more block sales affecting the token price suddenly. \n\nLikewise, we think that a show of long-term involvement with the project to our community will rebuild the trust lost during the token launch and subsequent downturn. \n\nProposal: \n\nWe\u2019re proposing using the model created by another successful token to protect the long-term health of the project and produce consistent distributions for our investors.\n\nThis would involve pooling all investment and team tokens into a liquidity pool that supports the security of the project and ensures optimal price execution.\n\nTo do this, we would amend the 1Earth vesting schedule to commence on November 19, 2022.\n\nAt this time, a trusted and vetted third party will act independently to liquidate the available pool of private tokens based on a percentage of the previous daily volume so it does not negatively impact the market. All proceeds will be distributed to investors proportionately according to their LP tokens.  \n\nThis liquidation will be done sustainably to protect the long-term health of the project, and is likely to result in 5 years of monthly distributions for you to collect from the EarthFund investor portal.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nThis change will involve the issuance of a Liquidity Pool token (1EarthLP) that will entitle each token holder to a pro-rata portion of the liquidity every month until all of the tokens in the pool have been sold.  \n\nEach month, investors will be able to connect their wallets to the token holder portal and collect EarthFund distributions in USDT (Tether).\n\nFor more information about EarthFund, please visit: earthfund.io\n","protocol":"earthfund","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x7fCb6b551C23018741E299e1e213697d539Ca978","totalVotes":10,"blockNumber":13992863,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/earthfundgovernance.eth\/proposal\/0xb1cf220e4a02ff35fc1e457f6262b7a0bf4e97309f513789bb489b69939b9056","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642006800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642395540}","startTimestamp":1642006800,"endTimestamp":1642395540,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, extend the vesting', 'No, do not extend the vesting']","results":"[{'total': 8540374, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

This proposal looks to further align the squad with the protocol by allocating them tokens subject to  vesting. This revocable & vested token allocation would align S#2 as a protocol partner and provide strong performance incentives.\n\n# Purpose\n\nMembers of the S#2 team has been active in the ESD community since  early in the protocol\u2019s life.

The liquidity program will cover both tokens, a Curve pool for the stable instrument and Uniswap for the share token.\n\n# Purpose\n\n### Liquidity\n\nUnlike V1, V2 does not directly require liquidity to stay stable. However we do want to bootstrap a small amount of liquidity as a showcase to potential partners that the new ESD stablecoin is live and safe under real-world conditions. Once ESD is more widely used in protocols, these incentives should no longer be necessary. To bridge this gap, we propose allocation 33,000,000 ESDS as a linear drip over the next year to bootstrap the ESD Curve market.\n\nAdditionally, we propose allocating 16,500,000 ESDS to bootstrap liquidity to the ESDS-ESD Uniswap market so that there is at least a minimal amount of day one liquidity to ease volatility during the migration process. This should also similarly be a temporary measure, and should therefore have a similar drip schedule.\n\n### Treasury\n\nOur community treasury has been incredibly successful in aligning ecosystem contributors. Since we no longer have an expansion tax, we\u2019d like to re-up the treasury as part of the V2 launch so that we can continue funding additional contributions.\n\nWe\u2019d like to propose allocating 49,500,000 ESDS to the treasury at this time as a lump sum, with the intention of allocating follow up grants to the treasury as needed via on-chain governance in the future.\n\n## Impact on Tokenomics\nBelow represents effects of this proposal + the protocol partnerships incentives w\/ DeFi Pulse on the total supply of ESD tokens at V2 launch.

By leveraging the Defi Pulse network, we believe that the pace of adoption for ESD can increase at a much faster rate.\nValue Proposition\n\nThe [Defi Pulse](https:\/\/defipulse.com\/)) team is deeply rooted in the DeFi ecosystem. It has one of the largest networks of curated partners in the space and a proven track record of developing innovative metrics and products. Among others, DeFi Pulse invented the \u2018Total Value Locked (TVL) Metric\u2019 and created the \u2018[Defi Pulse Index](https:\/\/www.pulse.inc\/)\u2019, which, with more than $200M assets under management, is the leading DeFi index. \n\nBy partnering with Defi Pulse, the Empty Set DAO will leverage the network of one of the most recognized and trusted actors in the space. This partnership will enhance the adoption of our protocol from scratch, increasing the issuance of ESD, our north star metric. \n\n## Funding\n\n### Initial allocation\n\nAs a strategic partner, the Defi Pulse team will be granted 16,500,000 ESDS as an initial allocation to start the program and become a stakeholder in the Empty Set DAO. These tokens will vest linearly for 2 years, in a revocable contract.\n\n### Defi Pulse treasury\n\nThe Empty Set DAO will bootstrap a treasury managed by the Defi Pulse business development team, which will be used to incentivize the adoption of ESD by a variety of protocols.The initial grant will be 5,000,000 ESDS. To reduce friction and increase efficiency, the Defi Pulse team will be able to provide grants to projects that are being onboarded, in an autonomous manner. Each time a protocol is successfully on-boarded by the business development team, Defi Pulse will earn \\$50K worth of ESDS as a success fee, directly paid from its treasury. Once capital is allocated, the Defi Pulse team will formalize a TIP to replenish its treasury through a vote.\n\n### Protocol growth program\n\nTo incentivize the adoption of ESD in the most relevant protocols, the Defi Pulse team will earn rewards for reaching TVL based milestones in each protocol that is on-boarded. At the end of each month, if a protocol has reached a TVL milestone, the DAO will reward the Defi Pulse team accordingly, with a 1% cut of that TVL. This reward will be capped to avoid large dilutions for ESDS holders, and will be vested linearly in a 2 years non revocable contract, in the same time schedule as the initial allocation (non restarting).\n\nBelow we can see the proposal for TVL milestones and rewards for protocols on-boarded by the Defi Pulse team.\n\n![img](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/E60Bs0q.png)\n\nEach reward is capped to avoid large dilutions according to the following formula, where:\n\n*Protocol ESDS valuation = (ESD TVL in protocol \/ Total ESD TVL) \\* FDV*\n\n**Max Milestone reward per protocol** = 1% * Protocol ESDS valuation\n\n## Wallets\n\nDefi Pulse will be using two distinct multisigs wallets for transparency purposes:\n\n**Wallet n1** - Initial allocation & rewards:\n\n`0x1008DA881d464B090b0970edbeaB7a91410cCF1B` \n\n**Wallet n2** - Defi Pulse treasury: \n\n`0x866613c804Be33e9D7899a41D4EfE880c0de1FaD`\n\n## Performance tracking\n\nTo track the performance of the Defi Pulse business development team, the Empty Set DAO, or any dedicated team, will be in charge of creating a dashboard with a list of all protocols that are on-boarded by Defi Pulse and their respective ESD TVL. The Defi Pulse team will also track these metrics to ensure a high level of accuracy.\n\nEvery monetary reward and milestone described in this proposal will use a 7 days TWAP methodology to mitigate risks tied to markets volatility.\n\n\n","protocol":"esd","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xB0B2b405c9D09d129E9F9b18c9DD218c532f2b2A","totalVotes":8,"blockNumber":12522107,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/esd.eth\/proposal\/QmVKTGTTgYhhzemXN7vdtxqKpWSLcL8QQ2pHzy8ur9rzAR","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1622203200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1622462400}","startTimestamp":1622203200,"endTimestamp":1622462400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 76644480, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

TIP Quorum Threshold\nWe are proposing to set a new TIP quorum threshold of **30m ESD** representative of roughly 6% of the supply.\n\nIn order for a TIP to pass and be eligible for its grant, the TIP will need to receive 30m ESD worth of `For` votes **in addition to** receiving more `For` votes than `Against` votes.\n\n## 2. Under-Peg Funding Bonus\nMonthly budget TIPs are negatively affected by ESD being under-peg. The last thing we want to do is disincentive our ecosystem contributors when times are tough.\n\nSince these these types of TIPs are usually pegged to a real-world USD-denominated budget, we'd like to make standard the notion of that these TIPs should be adjusting the ESD grant value each month based on the current `ESD` price at time of proposal.\n\nThis generally will not apply to one-off grant proposals, since the author may set their grant amount arbitrarily anyways, we just ask that voters take into account the current `ESD` price when making their decision.\n\n### Retro-active adjustments\nTIP-9 is currently on-going and would be eligible for this adjustment.\n\n#### TIP-9\nPrice at TIP-9 proposal: **$0.60**\nPrice at TIP-11 proposal: **$0.20**\n\nJanuary dispersement paid: **36300 ESD**\nJanuary adjustment: `(36300 * (1.00 - 0.60)) \/ 0.20` = **72600 ESD**\n\nFebruary disbursement due: **29300 ESD**\nFebruary adjusted due: `29300 \/ 0.20` = **146500 ESD**\n\nTIP-9 Feb Due + Jan Adj.: **219100 ESD**","protocol":"esd","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x37Ed74A0dA66c0392C4c5901c3b3B97675871FE1","totalVotes":27,"blockNumber":11812463,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/esd.eth\/proposal\/QmaBKrtw8j6gPkAUREsJhhZp4ML1BjL3yLqJt545YkPbxM","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1612771200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1612944000}","startTimestamp":1612771200,"endTimestamp":1612944000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, establish new standards and', 'No, keep current standards']","results":"[{'total': 100988550, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 0, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Returns from DAO inflation will accrue to the value of the xESD token. xESD will be fully fungible and transferable and will serve as a layer of abstraction for a staking process that may be confusing or intimidating to some investors. \n\n## Value Proposition\n* **Immediate liquidity**: xESD will be freely traded on DEXes, offering a single transaction on- or off-ramp for ESD investors. [xToken](https:\/\/twitter.com\/xtokenmarket) intends to heavily incentivize secondary liquidity of xAssets upon introduction of the XTK token (likely in Q1) and will dedicate a significant rewards allocation to xESD incentives.\n* **Better Collateral**: We're all agreed on the potential for ESD as stable, permissionless, truly decentralized collateral. The one missing ingredient is yield generation. There's really no reason for ESD depositors to forgo returns from DAO inflation. xToken is well into the process of building a simple lending protocol for xAssets, and xESD will of course be supported. Additionally, we would expect other lending protocols to support xESD as the project grows in size.\n* **Tax Advantages**: This value prop is domicile-specific, but for many investors, each DAO inflation distribution is a regular income taxable event. This represents hundreds of inefficient-rate taxable events for ESD stakers. In the case of xESD, rewards value accrues directly to the value of the token. Said another way, investors can elect when to invoke a taxable event (the sale of xESD) and, on a long enough time horizon, they may benefit from lower long-term rates.

This sale need not serve as binding precedent. Later on, If it so chooses, the DAO can vote to re-buy ESD at the target price. Alternatively, the DAO can vote to keep some\/all of these non-ESD assets as reserves, in line with the proposed fractional reserve system for ESD v2.\n\nBackground and Rationale:\n\nUntil now, the ESD Treasury has functioned as the primary source of funding for protocol research and development. Recently, however, a few of ESD\u2019s lay leaders have proposed a new vision for the protocol (ESD v2) in which the ESD Treasury will play an active role in price stabilization through a fractional reserves system.\n\nESD v2 is still being researched and debated. But at the moment, a provisional version of ESD v2\u2019s proposed price-stabilizing mechanism could prove quite beneficial to the health of the ESD network. ESD has been trading well above $1.03 (TWAP of the supply expansion ceiling) for more than three consecutive days. Like many other community members, we are thrilled with ESD\u2019s traction but wary of the negative effects of sustained overheating.\n\nIf passed, this proposal would facilitate a market sale of the Treasury\u2019s ESD into USDC by the protocol\u2019s multi-sig signers. It would enable the multi-sig signers to sell all of the 3+ million ESD that the Treasury currently holds, as well as future inflationary rewards while the price remains above the peg (if the Treasury does not sell future rewards, it will hold diversified reserves). As Will Price noted in the Discord, other ESD holders might front-run the treasury, but this would help to achieve the desired effect of the treasury sale in the first place.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that this ad hoc measure need not constitute rigid precedent. This is by no means a Trojan Horse attempt to rush through significant changes to the protocol. The debate over the details of ESD v2 will continue, and it is entirely plausible that ESD stakeholders will vote against a new design in which the Treasury plays an active, Central-Bank-esque role in stabilizing the ESD price. As such, in the future, the DAO could always vote to re-purchase ESD with its newly-acquired assets either closer to the target price or during a future contractionary phase. Alternatively, the DAO could choose to keep some or all of the purchased assets in the treasury for the foreseeable future, in line with the fractional reserve system proposed for v2.\n\nSpecifics:\n\nThe multi-sig signers will execute batched sales of ESD to USDC at their discretion in order to avoid potential sandwich attacks","protocol":"esd","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xC85170886A7F34e1365E2aA04486ae8F1106F783","totalVotes":97,"blockNumber":11473674,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/esd.eth\/proposal\/QmPbs3a67ZcnSd1EPvufwo4diW3gPBdQZ9rpGycEwqyJGo","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1608220800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1608393600}","startTimestamp":1608220800,"endTimestamp":1608393600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, Sell Treasury ESD to USDC', 'No, Leave Treasury in ESD']","results":"[{'total': 8123003.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 21660786, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

The Squad would help support development efforts, assist others in grant writing, integrations with other protocols, and contribute to reference materials.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the beginning there was a squad, the Empty Set Squad. They designed and developed ESD and released it into the world. After its launch, they helped develop and refine the protocol in collaboration with the community that has rallied around it.\n\nThe ESS it self, while present, has encouraged the community to flourish around the protocol. We've had numerous individuals step up to handle various aspects of the protocol's day to day management: development updates, integration requests, community management, protocol design and evangelism. With the addition of the treasury, ESD is now able to support community members requiring compensation to commit time to the protocol for development, protocol integrations, community building, and evangelism. \n\nWe feel that it is time for a new squad to help keep up with the ever growing attention and use it is getting. \n\n### A new squad: Squad Number 2 (SN2) \n\n![](https:\/\/y.yarn.co\/9ee0b128-2ccd-4e6c-b09a-7fd897b54ca3_text_hi.gif)\n\nSN2 is a group that will focus on supporting the ESD community as it grows and the protocol matures. The main focus will be on contributing to the communications, integrations, infrastructure and community of the protocol. \n\nThe squad will be led by Lewi.

The Squad would help support development efforts, assist others in grant writing, integrations with other protocols, and contribute to reference materials.\n\n## Background\n\nIn the beginning there was a squad, the Empty Set Squad. They designed and developed ESD and released it into the world. After its launch, they helped develop and refine the protocol in collaboration with the community that has rallied around it.\n\nThe ESS it self, while present, has encouraged the community to flourish around the protocol. We've had numerous individuals step up to handle various aspects of the protocol's day to day management: development updates, integration requests, community management, protocol design and evangelism. With the addition of the treasury, ESD is now able to support community members requiring compensation to commit time to the protocol for development, protocol integrations, community building, and evangelism. \n\nWe feel that it is time for a new squad to help keep up with the ever growing attention and use it is getting. \n\n### A new squad: Squad Number 2 (SN2) \n\n![](https:\/\/y.yarn.co\/9ee0b128-2ccd-4e6c-b09a-7fd897b54ca3_text_hi.gif)\n\nSN2 is a group that will focus on supporting the ESD community as it grows and the protocol matures. The main focus will be on contributing to the communications, integrations, infrastructure and community of the protocol. \n\nThe squad will be led by Lewi. He has been an active participant in the ESD community since early in the bootstrapping phase.

The first conservative step in this direction is to convert $150,000 (approximately 8.7% of the USDC in Treasury) into ETH. The timing of the conversion is also somewhat fortuitous as ETH is down 30% over the past 30 days (as of Jan 30, 2022). Treasury ownership of ETH also provides upside exposure to the larger value creation of Web3.\n\n### Investing USDC\n\nThe USDC currently sitting in treasury is \u2018unproductive\u2019, meaning it is not earning any yield. We are proposing conservatively investing $500,000 of USDC into a low-risk interest-bearing investment opportunity. One example would be depositing the USDC into an Aave savings account (yielding 2.16% as of Jan 30, 2021).

Clubs are groups of investors (no more than 99 individuals) pooling their own funds (no more than $20M total) to invest. Clubs can invest in both on-chain (NFTs, liquid tokens, etc.) and off-chain (startup equity, etc.) assets, and Syndicate's tools will automatically manage fundraising, cap table, and distributions for the Club.\n\nIn an investment club, there is no legal differentiation between members and managers -- thus, there is no carry or fees. The Club will appoint a manager to handle the technical aspects of the Club, ensure people are voting and send money, etc. However, from an investment perspective, all members hold equal voting weight and receive returns proportional to the amount of funds invested.\n\nClub Details\n------------\nClub Details:\n\n-   The Club will be open to Forefront contributors and core collaborators.\n-   After a 3 month trial period, the DAO may propose to open up the investment club to non-contributors (e.g. token-gating).\n-   Club administration (launch, technical support, etc.) will be managed by the Forefront Staff.\n\nLegal Limitations:\n\n-   The Club cannot hold more than $20M.\n-   The Club cannot have more than 99 members.\n-   Every member of the Club must actively participate in investment decisions (e.g. vote on each investment).\n-   The Club cannot receive funds from the DAO Treasury.\n-   The Club cannot distribute returns back to the DAO Treasury.\n\nBudget\n------\nSyndicate Protocol currently does not charge protocol fees. However, there are gas costs associated with creating an on-chain investment vehicle. While the gas costs are unpredictable, $1,000 is a decent ballpark. These funds will be paid out of the Forefront Treasury.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote Yes to approve Forefront Investment Club Proposal\nNo - Vote No to not approve Forefront Investment Club Proposal\n\n***\n\n*Value.

Of this $50,000, $25,000 will be donated as matching funds to the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 Advocacy Round, which focuses on helping to fund advocacy organizations like Fight for the Future who sit at the intersection of tech and crypto activism.\n\nThe remaining $25,000 will be used as matching funds for a \"Forefront Side-Round,\" an opportunity for Forefront to fund key partners, organizations, and individuals within our community.\n\nMotivation\n----------\nFrom [Gitcoin](https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/blog\/gitcoin-grants-quadratic-funding-for-the-world\/):\n\n\"Public goods create universally better outcomes for society. For those trapped in poverty, public goods are particularly essential, helping people meet basic needs. Public libraries for example --- assuming all else equal, can help educate the population indiscriminately (once again, this assumes the library offers truly equal opportunities to learn, and check out the resources needed).\n\nPublic Goods also serve those in privilege and power just as equally as those in poverty. We often don't notice it, but the majority of the value we consume in the world is public goods. After all, what value is your lambo to you if the sky is on fire? Funding Public Goods, ensuring they exist, and are accessible is often paramount to a society's advancement.\"\n\nForefront DAO is heavily dependent on public goods, from open source software to policy and research organizations pushing forward thinking and fighting for core principles of web3. Outside of the practical case, though, funding public goods is morally good. As the port of entry to web3, we have a responsibility to create and promote the culture that we want to see throughout the space. We should fund public goods because it is the right thing to do, and we should promote a culture that encourages the moral case rather than the practical one.\n\nAt the same time, Gitcoin's focus on Quadratic Funding is an exciting opportunity for Forefront to begin funding projects within our ecosystem to accelerate our progress as a DAO. The social token space is growing rapidly, and Forefront has the opportunity to establish itself as a critical pillar in the ecosystem.\n\nDetails\n-------\n### Advocacy Round\n\nThe Gitcoin Advocacy Round will be handled entirely by Gitcoin. Our only role will be funding ($25k) and promoting the round.\n\nForefront will be a matching partner. For more details on Gitcoin Grants, Quadratic Funding, and Matching Funds, please [give this article a read](https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/blog\/gitcoin-grants-quadratic-funding-for-the-world\/). This is extremely important  to understand how Gitcoin works and what Forefront's role will be.\n\n### Forefront Side-Round\nIn addition to the Gitcoin Advocacy Round, Gitcoin will support Forefront's own Side-Round. This will be an opportunity for the Forefront community to select and support key projects, partners, and stakeholders within our ecosystem. The Side-Round will also use Quadratic Funding ($25k matching funds), so please read the article linked above for more clarity.\n\nWe propose that Forefront DAO appoints a Side-Round Committee to coordinate the logistics of the Side-Round and select the projects that will be included for funding.\n\nThe Committee should include:\n\n-   One Forefront Staff member.\n-   One Culture Guild member.\n-   One Growth Guild member.\n-   One Writers Guild member.\n\nEach Guild will be responsible for appointing a representative to the Side-Round Committee within three days of this proposal passing. The Committee will have full autonomy to develop a process to select projects for the Side-Round.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote Yes to approve Forefront Public Goods Funding Proposal\nNo - Vote No to not approve Forefront Public Goods Funding Proposal\n\n***\n\n*Value.

Because 99% of the treasury is denominated by $FF, it remains highly unsustainable for the long-run development of the community.\n\nAs the Forefront DAO looks to expand its operations and onboard full time contributors, a diversified and sustainable treasury has become apparent. De-risking the treasury with more liquid and stable assets will allow us to fund operations and programs via USDC instead of FF tokens or exchanging $FF in the highly volatile open market which further alleviates the selling pressure on $FF.\n\nTo recap, along with posting the original proposal in the forum for an open discussion around the details and implications, we\u2019ve hosted three separate hangouts on our discord with potential strategic partners and community members. Recordings of these hangouts are available on our discord and can be accessed by any community member.\n\n## Specification\nWe propose exchanging 1,000,000 FF tokens held in the DAO Treasury to strategic partners and community members for $2,000,000 USDC at a fully diluted network valuation (FDNV) of $20M, or 2 USDC per $FF.\n\nOf the total exchange amount, 80% will be allocated to strategic partners, while 20% will be reserved to community members.\n\n**All proceeds of this strategic round will go directly to the DAO Treasury.**\n\n### Strategic Partners\nForefront staff has negotiated the final allocation amount with strategic partners, which are composed of community focused funds, founders, and angels. Final list and allocation as follows:\n\n| Name  |Allocation (FF) | \n| --- | ------- | \n| Pet3rPan (1kx) | 400,000 |  \n| Linda Xie (Scalar Capital) | 125,000 | \n| Own.fund Collective | 75,000 | \n| MetaCartel Ventures | 75,000 | \n| DeFi Collective | 40,000 |\n| Brett Shear (Palm Tree Crew) | 12,500 | \n| Andy Chen Fang (Synthetix) | 12,500 | \n| Jenil (Coinvise) | 12,500 | \n| Kevin Chou (Rally) |  12,500 | \n| Jacob Horne (Zora) | 12,500 | \n| Samantha Yap (YAP Global) |  7,500 | \n| Anthony Sassano (EthHub) |  7,500 | \n| Jesse Grushak |  7,500 | \n| **Total** |  **800,000 FF** | \n\n*Full list [here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1FcWOzbA_12_UbS5M6EHbAB4AcqYPkCB-B0derRljIxc\/edit?usp=sharing)* \n\nFF tokens acquired via strategic partners round will be subject to a **12 month cliff, plus an additional 12 month linear monthly unlock after the cliff.**\n\n### Community Round\nAs discussed in both the original and revised proposal, 20% of the round (200,000 FF) will be reserved for the community, prioritizing Forefront contributors as defined by Season One guidelines.\n\nForefront staff will be sending out an Interest Form in waves. This form will be timeboxed, and in line with the following criteria:\n\n- **Wave 1:** Current Contributors and Collaborators\n\u201cContributor\u201d will be formally defined based on the Season 1 definition. If you are an official member of a Guild and have gone through the onboarding flow, you are a contributor.\n- **Wave 2:** Past Contributors, NFT Holders, Merch Holders, Sourcecred Users, Snapshot Voters, Speakers\nHere, contributor is loosely defined to mean anyone who has completed an FF bounty, been a Hangout guest, or any other meaningful contribution to the community. NFT holders (Genesis NFT) and Metafactory Merch Holders are also included in this wave.\n- **Wave 3:** Forefront Community Members\nIf you are not a member of the above waves, Forefront members will still have access to the Community Allocation in a third and final wave. \n\nThe maximum individual community allocation will be $10,000USDC (min $1,000USDC). **If the round is not filled by Wave 3, the remaining Community Allocation will be rolled over to Strategic Partners. The Community Allocation period will last only 72 hours.**\n\nThe official dates will be announced after the Snapshot vote (assuming community approval).\n\nTokens acquired via Community Round are not subject to vesting.\n\n## Vote\nYes - Vote YES to approve the exchange\nNo - Vote NO to not approve the exchange \n\n***\n*Value.

The goal is to empower more cities to participate in the FWB Cities program. \n\nEqually, we want to make sure that the community members have freedom to do different types of activities while the core FWB values and framing are consistently upheld. There are three main documents that need to be read and agreed upon before submitting.\n1. [FWB Manifesto](https:\/\/www.fwb.help\/manifesto)\n2. [FWB Code of Conduct](https:\/\/github.com\/friends-with-benefits\/codeofconduct\/blob\/main\/code.md)\n3. [FWB Cities - Event Pattern Language ](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1EamPvpq7cu4ItkyY_72tic1Jrldkh7Zj\/view?usp=sharing)\n\n# Impact on FWB community \n\n* Expand to new cities without the cost full fledged city DAO\n* Creating the IRL events in new parts of the world\n* Recruiting tool for new members \n* Identify leaders\n\n# Specification\n## Overview\nThis proposal outlines the MVP of the FWB Event Key program to create a contained ten-event series for szn 5 to measure the success and prove the concept. \n## Discussion\nAs the FWB Cities subDAO expands, we are realizing there is a great desire from the community to host their own events. There needs to be a plan for other FWB Cities to participate in IRL programming. In true decentralized fashion, if we do not give a roadmap, people will build their own. \n\nOne issue with scaling events is keeping a cohesive vibe across events, with a bottle neck occurring at the approval phase. In order to circumvent those issues, we have written out a toolkit for FWB Event Key holders that ensures the events align with the FWB culture and vision.\n\nFWB Event Keys will not be fully fledged FWB parties that have exorbitant costs, but more along the lines of meetups, payable direct dinners, art crawls, etc things that are on the onus of the group to source. These will be trial runs where the main goal is more community building and less over the top event. \n## Budget \n* For szn 5: 10 FWB Event Keys in 10 new cities for 10 events. \n* Each FWB Event Key is worth $2,000 in $USDC\n* Community members awarded FWB Event Keys receive 5 $FWB\n* Community members awarded FWB Event Keys receive NFKey\n* Total cost of program: USD$35,250\n\nFor an itemised budget breakdown, including compensation for Event and Program coordinators, see the budget linked in the FWB Event Key Discord thread.\n\n## FWB Event Key Application + Criteria \n### Application judges\nPanel consisting of:\n* FWB Cities team members\n* 2 Community Members from each active FWB Cities\n\n### General \n\n* FWB Event Key Application can only come from existing FWB Cities Discord Channel\n* Submitted by FWB member, City or Full can apply\n* Multiple members can apply for one key\n* FWB Event Key will not be given to existing FWB Cities\n* One FWB Event Key will be awarded per city for MVP\n\n### Application \n\n* Name \/ Discord handle \n* City\n* Event Overview: Date, Location, Activity\n* Event Goals: What does success look like?\n* Attendance expectations\n* Relevant experience\/qualifications\n\n## FWB Event Key Reporting \n\n* Event Name \n* City\n* Date \n* Flyer \/ POAP \n* Description \/ Type of Event  \n* Event Goals \n* Attendance \n* FWB Members \/ Non\n* 3 Things That Went Well\n* 3 Things Could Improve upon \n* Photos \n* Social Media Links + Media (if any)\n## Roadmap\n\nThis is a MVP for SZN 5 to see if this program can be successful.

You no longer need to show up in real time to catch all of the great interviews and content that FWB has to offer. FWBAMP will also act as a token gated entry point for outsiders to get a glimpse of all of the great content that FWB has to offer.\n\n# Motivation\nWe are inspired by and engaged in all of the great chats that happen daily in the FWB Discord, but we know that many members can\u2019t join in real time.We need a way to streamline the process of consuming archived events. Currently, Adam and Zo\u00eb are manning the archive manually: recording using GarageBand (or Craig when available) and uploading to Google Drive, then pasting a link in a private Google Sheet, then pasting the link back on the Events page on Discord. Current archive can be found [here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1BmwmZmuWIQuo0MwPNWyS7-QjG7XCQv5yE7UIEQq-ZG4\/edit#gid=0).\n\nWe are excited to make the first version of this product, and know that it will unlock future opportunities for revenue generation and increased community engagement\n\n# Impact on FWB Community\nThis would benefit the FWB community by allowing more members to consume events that they may not be able to attend in real time. This may in turn increase community engagement. Want to get involved in the social-impact initiatives but haven\u2019t been able to make it to any of their chats? No problem! Take a listen to the archived talks and decide if you want to dive in. Having an archive will ultimately enable FWB to replay shows at different times, repurpose great content into podcasts and get sponsors for these podcasts to generate revenue. There are also opportunities to give lower tier FWB holders access to the archives as an incentive to ante in at the local level or something similar. Finally, having things like the Product meetings and different governance meetings recorded will give us a **historical record of FWB** to look back on as we grow!\n\n# Details\n## Overview\nThe goal of the FWBAMP project is to automate the recording and storage of digital events, increase the quality of those recordings, and provide a great user facing experience for playback of those recordings. This proposal is for the first iteration, which is a bit more hands on, while we flesh out the technical requirements for a fully automated solution. There is also an aspect of this project that involves an archivist writing shownotes for each event, and when we do this, we begin to build a historical record of FWB that can be revisited in perpetuity.\n\n1.  **Website**: We already have some mocks for this, but a sleek web interface that is searchable, filterable, and token-gated where people can go to look for archived shows is a must!  \n\n2.  **Uploading**: Uploading will be done using a CMS that Product is creating. Files will be uploaded to a central repository with the relevant metadata (date, name, show description). The user facing website will then point to these audio files and they will play in-browser.\n    \n3.  **Recording**: For the time being, we have a solution for this: using the new WireTap bot, show hosts will be able to record their shows. Adam and Zoe will continue to support as needed for recording as well, but the goal is to have this be a show host responsibility as soon as possible.  \n      \n4.  **Discord Integration**: In the events channel, or perhaps in a dedicated channel, would be great to automate the posting of links to recently archived shows.\n    \n5.  **Future State** *(Not currently in scope)*: As we scale, there will be a need for an automated workflow for recording all digital events taking place on the FWB Discord that are on the calendar. We should also make sure that members continue to be able to trigger recordings in real time for chats that aren\u2019t prescheduled.\n\t- Make sure that the recording bot has all notifications muted in its user profile\n\t- Start recording 5 mins before and end 5 mins after each event.\n\t- Bonus points if we can figure out how to capture the video or screen share.\n    \n## Roadmap\n\n1.  Make the website. Even though we are working from google docs, if we could get the website going it would improve the community wide experience and it is pretty low hanging fruit. Website will also include a counter to give us deeper insights into listenership.\n    \n2.  Make the CMS. This will be the place that archivists and show hosts can upload recordings and edit the metadata that will display on the website.\n    \n3.  Hook website and CMS up to the new file storage solution.\n    \n4.  Optimize use of MEE6 (WireTap bot) for audio recording while we explore automation options for the future.\n\n## Outcomes and Success Measures\nLuckily it is pretty easy to measure success here. The first goalpost is to streamline the way to get events recorded and uploaded to a server. The second goalpost is to get the website up and running so that people can play things from the archive. We want to see that, with the archive site, listenership for discord events and town halls increases from that observed in real time. That spells success! Before we decide what to tackle next, we will see how people engage with this MVP and then start to build out more functionality.\n\n## Looking forward\nWe think that there are tons of things you could do with this in the future:\n-   Create RSS feeds of content for people\n-   Make a custom player where users can cue in the shows they want to catch up on\n-   Improved automation of recording and uploading\n-   Archiving other media types (videos, rich content from irl events, tl;dr, other editorial products).\n    \nThis archive project is just the first step toward getting a more dynamic events schedule in place. I think that you can use the analogy of college radio here. We could have a full program guide, maybe even 24\/7 where people tune in and something is always on. The archive could be used to fill \u201cdead air\u201d and events can be replayed in those slots. There are other proposals floating around like FWB Radio, but that feels like just part of what this could be. We can have music programming, interview programming, current events shows, etc. Having an archive gives us a huge boost toward experimenting with other parts of this. We could open up show proposals more widely and build a full schedule of programming ultimately that showcases the interests of more FWBers and foster an even stronger sense of community. Digital events provide real time places for conversation and community building, but archiving, syndicating and distribution will allow sustained engagement and provide a historical record of how we grow as a community and how far we have come.\n\n## Budget\n**Budget is $19k**\n\n- **Design**: \u201cConsider that part already done,\u201d Bodge. $0\n- **Development**: Product estimates this phase to cost $10k to develop the CMS and website.\n- **Project Management**: Zoe (@zoenrogers#6096) will be in charge of project management and will take on half of the recording and uploading burden. ~ part-time, $1500\/month. (Jan, Feb, March)\n- **Archivist**: Adam (@bartadamley#7554) will be in charge of writing show descriptions for each recorded event (Editorial) and will take on half of the recording and uploading burden. ~ part-time, $1500\/month. (Jan, Feb, March)\n\n## Timeline\nWe have already unofficially started with this project in the world of google docs and google sheets, we should start making it better as soon as possible. We have the goal of getting the recording and uploading dialed in by end of Season 4\/early Season 5. We hope to get the website and CMS up and running early in Season 5. We are targeting the end of March as the end of this project.","protocol":"friendswithbenefits","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x2afE4De9D1C679E42C03649D86FFDDDc07751AE6","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13981353,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/friendswithbenefits.eth\/proposal\/0xe4522be0a6faacdfb99e4924d43284269681d0e57e79ed6b22619560dec1bb8c","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641916800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642233540}","startTimestamp":1641916800,"endTimestamp":1642233540,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - Fund FWB AMP', 'No - Do not fund']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

Gatekeeper by FWB: it\u2019s not who you keep out, it's who you let in. \n\n# Motivation\nGatekeeper makes it simple to create token-enabled experiences. \n\nGatekeeper has become a core tool both for FWB and for several partners during NFT NYC to run their own events. We now want to support the existing momentum behind Gatekeeper, establishing a dedicated team to take it to the next level. Gatekeeper will create the tools for any community to facilitate access to token-enabled experiences, both physical and digital.\n\nGatekeeper is one of FWB\u2019s first home grown products, born directly from the community in response to the lack of web3 native token-gated tooling. This product (Gatekeeper IRL) has largely been used internally at FWB, with a few partnerships done manually for NFT NYC. To date, Gatekeeper has recorded 6,400 RSVPs across 3 internal and 4 partner events in a span of 2 months. \n\nSince then, a small team has been working on a digital counterpart to the IRL product which we will call Gatekeeper URL. Gatekeeper URL will allow for token-enabled digital experiences and is set to launch by mid December 2021. Use case examples include ERC20 or ERC721 gated newsletters, articles, web experiences, and more. The core team working on this version is Gabe Q (PM and comms), Bodge, Iain and Breck (engineering), Gabe F (design), and Hendisco (advisor). Note: the initial scope and budget for the URL team has already been finalized with the product team through season 4 and does not affect this proposal. \n\n# Specification\n### Strategy and Roadmap\n##### Phase 1: Public Release of Gatekeeper \n_Timeline: January - February 2022_\n\nDuring this phase, we will release v1 of both Gatekeeper URL and IRL under one umbrella Gatekeeper brand. This means that anyone will be able to access a FWB-hosted Gatekeeper marketing site and either build a gated RSVP page and issue tickets for their IRL event OR use our admin panel and documentation to gate digital content (websites, docs, newsletters etc).\n\nThis release will coincide with an established v1 revenue model behind Gatekeeper.\n\n##### Phase 2: Staffing and Infrastructure \n_Timeline: Season 5-6_\n\nLearning from v1 product feedback, the Gatekeeper team will iterate on the product and revenue model released in Phase 1 (above). Together with the community, the Gatekeeper team will set the future product strategy, roadmap, and revenue model.\n\nGatekeeper will staff additional roles including designers, engineers, and sales \/ account managers. **If you\u2019d like to contribute or apply, please reach out to contribute@fwb.help or DM Gabe Q.**\n\nGatekeeper will still lean on the FWB DAO infrastructure during this phase, tapping into benefits such as payroll, product resources, editorial etc. The Gatekeeper team will work closely with FWB leadership for the future expansion of this project.. \n\n##### Phase 3: Gatekeeper subDAO\n_Timeline: Season 7 onward_\n\nThe future Gatekeeper team will work toward establishing its own subDAO infrastructure and explore additional tokenization and incentive mechanisms to exist as its own stand alone entity.\n\nThrough this process, a portion of the Gatekeeper token supply will be owned by the FWB DAO.\n \n### Success Measures\nSuccess will be measured by the following objectives and results. \n\n##### Season 5: Create and launch the first public facing FWB product that anyone in the web3 space can use. \n* **Result 1:** Engineer a functional MVP of Gatekeeper URL (along with supporting documentation) by EOY 2021.\n* **Result 2:** Create a marketing site and public facing Gatekeeper IRL product. Have a live site in which users can access both Gatekeeper products by early Season 5. \n* **Result 3:** Write a launch post that explains what we are building and announces it publicly. Use that momentum to acquire 6 target DAOs or organizers within 30 days of launch. \n\n##### Season 6: Achieve community market fit with Gatekeeper\n* **Result 1:** Establish lean staffing budget and bring on additional contributors \n* **Result 2:** Grow RSVPs MoM by 20% from launch\n* **Result 3:** Launch v2 of Gatekeeper product based on iterations from previous launch and improve NPS. \n\n##### Season 7: Launch Gatekeeper sub-DAO\n* **Result 1:** Create future product roadmap and share publicly  \n* **Result 2:** Launch crowdfund of Gatekeeper sub-DAO  \n* **Result 3:** Establish legal frameworks needed to operate as a separate entity \n* **Result 4:** Airdrop tokens to FWB DAO, Gatekeeper team, and crowdfund participants and launch new discord to begin the standalone Gatekeeper sub-DAO. \n\n### Budget \nThe Gatekeeper team will cost ~ $26,000 monthly. Should this proposal be approved, the FWB treasury would support this burn rate for 6-9 months as we work through the three phases outlined above. After these months, the FWB DAO would receive a portion of the initial token allocation for the Gatekeeper subDAO. \n\nNote that this burn and budget do not take into account any revenue brought in by Gatekeeper or the future ownership that FWB DAO will have in the Gatekeeper subDAO. We expect this initial investment to incubate the team will pay off considerably. \n\n# Benefits\n* **Access:** As we saw at NFT NYC, FWB members got access to additional, quality experiences organized by other DAOS as Gatekeeper powered their events. We see a world where Gatekeeper becomes a widely used tool and FWB becomes the ultimate cultural membership that opens doors to numerous parallel experiences. \n* **Brand building:** Building open source tools for the larger web3 ecosystem builds the FWB brand reputation externally and attracts more members to our DAO. \n* **Revenue generation:** As Gatekeeper expands we will begin capturing on-chain revenue for the FWB treasury. The FWB DAO will also own a portion of the Gatekeeper subDAO. \n* **Opportunities for personal compensation:** Funding this team will create opportunities for builders and engineers within FWB to be compensated for building the future of Gatekeeper. \n\n# Considerations\n* A subDAO could create a subdivision of the FWB community.\n* Funding this team would increase FWBs current burn rate.","protocol":"friendswithbenefits","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x4e98Cd5543f95A61522E038CA75620395b051acC","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13955018,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/friendswithbenefits.eth\/proposal\/0x0525ab47a3d02c3a8d9f2ce3b00a424784953d28e41548543c0c57c59d8160cf","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641564000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642168800}","startTimestamp":1641564000,"endTimestamp":1642168800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - Fund FWB Gatekeeper.', 'No - Do not fund.']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

In FWB Season 5, the FAiR program will strengthen FWB\u2019s position as the ultimate cultural membership by giving community members the opportunity to select artists and fund their living expenses, allowing them to focus on creating.\n\nThe FAiR program will also add value for community members in the form of live shows held three times each month, where each resident will join the FAiR Content Host to discuss how their art and their process is intersecting with Web3, answer questions from the community, or speak about whatever subject matter they\u2019re most passionate about.  The three-month residency will culminate in a live \u201cResidency Release Party\u201d, where artists will share their work with the rest of FWB.\n\nIn the long term, the FAiR program will help FWB position itself as a hub for culture and creativity.  With the addition of the #artist-residency-alum channel, past, present, and future FAiR alum will be able to connect.  As FWB becomes a space known for facilitating new partnerships, friendships, and interdisciplinary collaborations, the community will become even more attractive to the growing Web3 creator class.\n\n## Details:\nMore details about the FAiR program can be found in the [long form proposal document here.](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1UUQBSZdFogbVDkCxzrPU9O3y2mFKsSweCWE_MGv9xEo\/edit?usp=sharing ).\n\nProgram application and voting ballot forthcoming.\n\nFor this pilot season of FAiR, applications will only be open to current FWB members.\n\n## Timeline: \nThe dates provided in the document below outline the important deadlines that we must meet in order to welcome the first cohort of residents alongside the start of FWB Season 5.\n\n[The timeline may be viewed here.](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1gDszgr3zeiN5cB06RgGFNZgKMVA6xwUjs7b0Dzwhvs8\/edit) \n\n## FAiR Team Roles and Responsibilities:\nThe roles listed below are initially filled by the FAiR Hackathon team members to ensure the smooth roll-out of the FAiR program.

FWB will purchase a number of cases of the new product and receive a profit share on all cases sold. \n\n## Motivation \nAfter years of buying club mate by the case, we thought it was time to make our own. Not only is a FWB spin on club mate well aligned with our community (from Discord to dance floor), creating a physical product will allow us to build the playbook for DAO x physical product collaborations going forward. \n\n## Details \n[Taika](https:\/\/taika.co\/about\/) is an innovative beverage company with a special brand and ethos. First focused on coffee, the team has recently expanded into Matcha. Taika beverages are ready to drink, adaptogen-infused, and focus on the \u201cdestination\u201d i.e. how the drinks make you feel. \n\nWithin this partnership, Taika will be responsible for the food science (R&D), production, logistics, and co-marketing efforts. We will lean on their expertise to develop, source, price, and deliver the beverage.  \n\nFWB will be responsible for co creating the design and marketing efforts around the launch. In order for us to leverage this opportunity, we will be coordinating the launch across multiple platforms (in-person, social, thought leadership etc.) and will be determining that in tandem with Taika and the nominated working group. \n\nAs an FWB member, you will have two avenues through which you can get involved with this partnership. You will be able to either:\n\n- Apply to be part of a paid **working group**. This will be a smaller group of more active contributors creating designs and marketing collateral. \n\n- OR opt-in to a volunteer **focus group** which will be equally significant. As part of the focus group, you will commit less time to the project but still participate in product tastings, providing direction on taste and feel of the beverage. You will also vote on the work created by the working group, having a say in the end product design, marketing etc. \n\n## Benefits for the FWB community\n- **Brand building:** We expect to create a cultural \"moment\" through this initiative, further elevating FWB as a pioneer in the space. This will  generate more cultural capital for members of the community and FWB at large.\n- **Financial:** Generate financial returns from a product partnership. \nStrategic: Develop a blueprint for future product collaborations (e.g. apparel). \n- **Internal Value:** Create a product which will be available to FWB members and at gatherings.\n- **Internal Opportunity Value:** Create more opportunities for FWB members to creatively contribute and benefit financially to internal and external projects.\n\n## Terms\nThis will not be a standard partnership in which FWB charges Taika a fee for our involvement. Instead, the partnership will be set up on a profit share agreement. The initial goal will be to produce two runs of the beverage, a pilot and first production run. \n\n[Here is a financial model with an overview of the financials of the partnership.](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1PyGfxf0-vj4tUquBvk0ONL3KtsH2i2zpmLA53S9_820\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Budget \nBeyond the terms above, this project will establish a compensation pool allocated for the working group. There will be a total of $10,000 available for working group members which will be allocated by each individual\u2019s scope on the project. This cost will be split 50\/50, with both Taika and FWB contributing $5,000. \n\nBetween FWBs contribution to the compensation pool as well as our purchases of the product and shipping costs, this partnership will require an investment of $18,530 from the DAO. \n\n## Revenue\nWith this investment, FWB will acquire ~495 cases of the beverage at cost that we can resell at FWB events and experiences (should we decide to do so).  We will also earn an 18% profit share on Taika\u2019s subsequent sales of the beverage. Therefore, we expect this investment to generate a return as we sell the beverage and produce additional runs.  \n\n## Success Measurement\nWe will measure the efficacy of this partnership using the same categories listed in the benefits section above. The success of this collaboration will be determined by:\n- Attracting meaningful media and social attention to our drop and partnerships strategy \n- Generating a financial return that at least offsets our initial investment \n- Defining a playbook for physical product collaborations that we can reproduce \n- Creating paid working opportunities for FWB members to contribute \n- Providing a novel and fun experience for any FWB members who participate in the co-creation of the beverage.   \n## Timeline\nUpon approval this partnership would launch immediately and continue into Season 5. \n","protocol":"friendswithbenefits","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x01503DC708ce3C55017194847A07aCb679D49f47","totalVotes":189,"blockNumber":13767331,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/friendswithbenefits.eth\/proposal\/0xa7f8ce8af120cf6f823b7f0a68ac443af15b066542d8dd77815873d1629cd2bb","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639004400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639263600}","startTimestamp":1639004400,"endTimestamp":1639263600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - Approve partnership & fund', 'No - Do not approve & fund']","results":"[{'total': 22558.996, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 7154.5493, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Therefore, we view revenue as a trailing indicator. A reward that occurs when we partner with those who do right by our community.  \n\nWith that perspective in mind, the partnership team will oversee three partnership activation programs:\n\n- **Cultural Activations** - partner with brands for co-utility. No upfront cash, focused on utility, experience, and brand building. \n- **Access** - FWB members will receive exclusive\/early access or discounts to products and services. Most likely activated at the FWB channel level (i.e., skincare, mental health, food, gaming etc.).\n- **Revenue Driving** - partners pay FWB to co-create valuable opportunities for FWB members.\n\n\n## Existing Pipeline\nTo demonstrate the opportunity behind activating an FWB partnerships team, our (thus far part-time & volunteer) team has already developed a strong pipeline of 9 potential deals for a possible $600,000+ of new revenue. An overview of the deals in the pipeline, including a community-facing proposal for each, is available for FWB members upon request. Please contact Gabe Q.#2254 on Discord for more information. \n\n## Budget\nThis proposal is for the FWB treasury to fund a FWB Partnerships team for two seasons (4 and 5). The monthly burn rate will be $16,900. This burn includes legal fees for structuring contracts on specific partnerships as well as a small travel & entertainment budget for negotiating deals. However, this burn rate doesn\u2019t take into account the offsetting revenue that partnerships can and will bring in. While revenue is not the priority with these deals, we expect to more than offset monthly burn with revenue-generating partnerships. \n \nThe Season 4 budget would be back paid to contributors for work done thus far. [Full budget breakdown can be found here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1m7Xr2FSr1hmn6U-77mWSx9UXoVWkpGkkBNZcNEdhGbI\/edit). \n\n## Outcomes and Success Measures \nThe nuance in determining what success looks like for our team is that we are not treating revenue as the leading priority in our partnerships. While many of the partnerships that we do will bring revenue to FWB, we hope to be a bit different from a traditional partnerships team in that we are equally interested in brand building, and providing unique experiences to our community. \n\nTherefore, we will be measuring success via the following objectives and results:\n\n#### Objective 1: Achieve (at least) breakeven, offsetting team cost with new partnership revenue by end of Season 5. \n- Result: Secure at least $55,000 in partnership revenue in season 5. \n- Result: Keep team burn below incoming revenue in season 5.\n\n#### Objective 2: Generate access to novel experiences for the FWB community \n- Result: Secure partnerships that create at least 3 new experiences (IRL events, dinners, pop-ups, digital programming etc) that FWB members can access per season.\n\n#### Objective 3: Create new opportunities for FWB members to be compensated for their creative work \n- Result: Secure at least 2 partnerships per season that generate working opportunities for FWB members to be paid for engaging with said partner. \n\n#### Objective 4: Establish FWB as a thought leader on what DAO partnerships can look like \n- Result: FWB is referenced in at least 2 organic press pieces for unique partnerships that we create. \n\n## Benefits \n- Provides exclusive opportunities & benefits to FWB members.\n- Drives revenue to grow & improve our operations.\n- Co-creates opportunities to support the creative class.\n- FWB further cements its position as a thought leader by co-creating first of their kind programs and activations.\n\n## Drawbacks\nIn some cases partnerships will place additional demand on FWB team leads\u2019 time, at an opportunity cost of internal projects.\nPartnering with different brands could subject FWB to potential PR mishaps or other issues that may arise on the partner\u2019s side.\n","protocol":"friendswithbenefits","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x01503DC708ce3C55017194847A07aCb679D49f47","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13641334,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/friendswithbenefits.eth\/proposal\/0x9234720c012938489639cbb2b1f62f7322d99dbaab9969326e8a11c8764bcafb","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637269200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637729940}","startTimestamp":1637269200,"endTimestamp":1637729940,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - Fund FWB Partnerships Team', 'No - Do NOT fund Prtnrships Team']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

This proposal will establish a team to build on this conversation and develop an NFT program to serve the FWB community and beyond. \n \n## Purpose:\n\nFWB believes that NFTs offer a meaningful opportunity to experiment at the intersection of creation, curation, and commerce. The FWB NFT Team will provide a curatorial perspective and elevate NFT culture.\n\n## Mission:\n \nFWB NFT will focus on creating tools, services, and opportunities for members to navigate this emerging territory while pushing the boundary forward on quality artistic experiences.\n \n## Strategy:\n\n#### 1. Custom Tools\n\nFWB NFT will evolve the NFT category to create better architecture and resource pools for artists, while increasing accessibility to the NFT space. \n\nFWB will prioritize a Web3 Open Source software approach, similar to that of Redhat, MongoDB, and Discourse with revenue derived from hosting and support as a service. \n\n#### 2. FWB Curatorial Team \n\nFWB Curatorial Team will be platform agnostic, giving us flexibility while allowing us to capture value across realms.  The FWB Curatorial Team will also steward the [FWB Gallery](https:\/\/gallery.fwb.help\/) as one of the go-to-market options for artists. \n \nThe FWB NFT Team will prioritize diverse voices through three primary outlets. A) The Curatorial team will feature two curators to start, selected by the FWB DAO, that will be balanced in gender, race, and perspective. These roles will have an annual term limit, with ability to renew upon community vote if other candidates should choose to campaign. B) The FWB Curatorial team will form an Advisory Board featuring more diverse voices for contributors who may not have the time to curate but whose input, perspective, and background would be of value. C) The FWB Curatorial team will establish a process by which anyone in the community can submit curatorial projects for review by the community and the Curatorial Team. \n\nThis department will be one of FWB NFT\u2019s primary revenue lines through ownership percentages or percentage fees of NFT projects that are auctioned, commissioned, or sold. FWB NFT would aim to take anywhere from 1 - 10% with possibility to scale higher depending on level of involvement.\n \n## Plan \/ Process:\n \n#### Phase 1: Staffing and Infrastructure | 6 MONTHS - 1 YEAR\n\nFWB DAO to establish an initial FWB NFT workstream led by two functions: \n \n(1) Operations \n(2) Curatorial \n\nOperations will drive day to day ops of the FWB NFT department, help execute NFT projects, build access points for the community to contribute, lead development of FWB NFT tooling, and manage processes and payroll.\n \nCuratorial will be responsible for curating NFT projects, managing the FWB Gallery, collaborating with future NFT investing functions, and interfacing with artists and creators within FWB.\n \nFor Phase 1, this department will work within the FWB DAO and with its current leadership to utilize operational processes such as payroll, KPIs, goals, and other FWB DAO resources such as Product Team and Editorial Team. \n \nThe FWB DAO will work with active stakeholders and community members in #nft-general-chat to staff the team for the first term and then will transition to elected upon roles once the roadmap is established.  If you\u2019d like to contribute or apply, please reach out to contribute@fwb.help.\n \n#### Phase 2: $FWB-NFT DAO + Token\nThe future FWB NFT Team will work toward establishing its own DAO infrastructure and explore additional tokenization and incentive mechanisms to exist as its own stand alone entity, with a portion of the total supply being owned by the FWB DAO.\n \n## Budget:\nFWB DAO to fund FWB NFT for one year of runway.\n \nProposed Year 1 staffing budget is 250,000 USDC which can be found [here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1fRuQSO2FCChqWT2tEAUw6phDw3grocRFrFOaRayfTEk\/edit?usp=sharing), at a monthly burn rate of $20,833. Team members have the ability to receive compensation in FWB or USDC but for budgeting processes, we budget in USDC. \n \n## Benefits:\n \n- Capitalize and support an existing sub community of highly engaged NFT collectors, artists and builders within the FWB ranks. \n- Creates more inclusive opportunities for FWB members at large to participate in the NFT discussion.\n- Generate meaningful on-chain revenue through the commissioning and auctioning of NFT projects. \n\n## Drawbacks:\n \n- Creates fragmentation of community efforts\n- Not a good current allocation of funding \n","protocol":"friendswithbenefits","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x01503DC708ce3C55017194847A07aCb679D49f47","totalVotes":134,"blockNumber":13602715,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/friendswithbenefits.eth\/proposal\/0x9759d8c9bebd252b2b37e1d3fc9a2ee65eecfdad12b23bb36a0fd28278b4a7e8","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1636740000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637211540}","startTimestamp":1636740000,"endTimestamp":1637211540,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - Fund FWB NFT', 'No - Do NOT Fund FWB NFT']","results":"[{'total': 19610.043, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1081.9409, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Given that the current price of the $FWB token makes the cost of membership prohibitive for many, we are proposing this new diversification strategy to introduce alternative onramps. \n \nBy introducing a more accessible tier for FWB Events and Cities, we will open a new gateway for people to experience the community before making the leap to our current core membership threshold of 75 $FWB.\n\n\n# Specifications\n\nIntroducing FWB Local as a new token tier at 5 $FWB to engage members in FWB Events and Cities\n \nFurther discussion will be had with newly elected City team leadership to determine if specific events will require membership application approval or not. \n \n# Events\n \n **IRL Events**:\n-   FWB DAO organized meetups, parties, events, conferences, and physical experiences shouldn\u2019t be limited to just those who hold 75 $FWB and would benefit all around from more diversity of participants. \n \n-   FWB Events serve as a more ideal onramp to help bring in new members by interacting and participating in local community experiences. \n \n-   Events will strive to operate at a breakeven business model through either pooling of capital through city community members, sponsorship subsidy, or additional forms of revenue. \n \n**Digital Events**:\n\n-   Digital Events also serve as another great access point for members at the Local level. Digital events include Coffee Time, Seed Club\u2019s talk, and many more educational experiences that occur on the FWB Discord. This will also grant access to the FWB chat-text channels that run alongside digital programming but only if they are qualified members via application approval. \n\n# Cities\n \nFWB has established three Cities\u2014 London, New York, and Los Angeles \u2014as the originating sub-DAOs within the FWB ecosystem. \n \nCities will host in-person experiences from happy hours, gallery tours, and listening parties to local partnerships with restaurants and pop-up community meeting spaces. We believe the strongest onramp into FWB is through participating in local community and governance. \n \nFWB Local will grant access to all FWB #city-channels.\n \n# Channel Architecture\n \nThe Local threshold tier will include, but not limited to, the following channels within the Discord: \n \n**Welcome Category**\n-   Announcements\n-   Welcome\n-   Get-Involved\n-   All Cities General Chat\n \n**Cities**\n\nFWB CITY DAOS \/ FWB LA\n-   la-general\n-   la-events\n\nFWB CITY DAOS \/ FWB NYC\n-   nyc-general\n-   nyc-events\n\nFWB CITY DAOS \/ FWB LONDON\n-   ldn-general\n-   ldn-events\n\nFWB CITIES*\n-   BERLIN \n-   MIAMI\n-   SF\n-   ETC\n \n \n*These singular city channels will expand out once official CityDAO infrastructure is rolled out upon enough demand and expressed leadership. \n \n# Benefits:\n-   Drives engagement into our FWB City channels, which is our core Season 4 focus.\n-   Improving diversity and quantity of desired members,\n-   Lowering financial barriers to participate in events and IRL experiences. \n# Drawbacks:\n-   Huge surge of new applicants and need to staff up the membership committee to handle applications.  \n-   Potentially introducing a two tier class system into FWB.\n-   A sense of FOMO for those who hold 5 and can\u2019t afford 75.\n\n# Season 3 POAP Claim\n\nAnd to all those who were along for the ride for Season 3, and to thank you for voting on this proposal, claim your official Season 3 POAP after you submit your vote.   \n\nS3\u2019s POAP was designed by artist, designer, and creative Eric Hu in anticipation of his upcoming generative NFT series dropping October 7th, in which FWB members have been automatically registered in the presale.

Additionally, those who provide liquidity to either Uniswap or Balancer are also counted (see the strategies available [here](https:\/\/docs.snapshot.page\/strategies)).\n\nThe rationale for 1000 $FRONT is as follows:\n\n1. Current spot rate of $FRONT on the market is approximately .24 USDT. 1000 tokens, therefore, is 240 USDT and not (subjective) a large barrier to entry into Frontier community decisionmaking.\n2. The top ~450 wallets for $FRONT all hold more than 1000 tokens, give or take a few wallets at the time of writing. \n3. Higher threshold on token count means that someone who is signaling a vote has a vested interest in what we are attempting to accomplish at [Frontier](https:\/\/frontier.xyz\/).\n\nThere are downsides to this approach, to be sure: \n\n1. If the [spot price](https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/en\/coins\/frontier) of $FRONT rises drastically, then the barrier of entry to becoming a Frontier voter goes down.\n2. 240 USDT is not a small sum of money in some parts of the world.\n3. Some may argue that holding 1 $FRONT should be enough to hold a vote in our community. \n\nThese are valid concerns. While we work on building out our roadmap for community development (Discord channel, long-form discussion forum, etc.), we should conclude on a minimum $FRONT per wallet count for non-trivial decisions about proposals that Core members accept or propose. \n\nDo note that this voting portal, while currently open to any $FRONT holder with a wallet balance greater than 1000, is not \"vote passes; therefore, an implementation will happen\". This is an experiment in community building that we are attempting to handle with voting, long-form discussion, and a mix of chats.\n\n**How many $FRONT held should be accepted into community voting?**\n\nVote below. Voting ends approximately one week from today. $FRONT held at block [11290000](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/block\/countdown\/11290000) snapshot will be counted.","protocol":"frontier","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xfC43f5F9dd45258b3AFf31Bdbe6561D97e8B71de","totalVotes":31,"blockNumber":11290000,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/frontier\/proposal\/QmUY4TYPUP3ygqrW6f48kDdmRjH5dCWbCN4xHQt2Cr132Q","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1605546000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1606150800}","startTimestamp":1605546000,"endTimestamp":1606150800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['1000', '500', '100', '50', 'Greater than 1']","results":"[{'total': 59865.875, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 9316.534, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 0, 'choice': 4}]","events":"[]"}

","content":"The proposal is available [here](https:\/\/forum.gnosis.io\/t\/gip-13-phase-2-cowdao-and-cow-token\/2735\/1). It is recommended to read it in the forum where proper formatting is available.\u00a0\n\nThe proposed deployment code for this proposal is available [here](https:\/\/github.com\/gnosis\/cow-token\/) and an audit is available [here](https:\/\/github.com\/gnosis\/cow-token\/blob\/main\/audits\/2021-12_G0-group.pdf).\n\n# What is CowDAO envisioned to be?\u00a0\n\nCowDAO is an open organization of developers, traders, market makers and many more community members aligned with its vision. CowDAO is focused on fair and decentralized trading systems - in particular, building, maintaining and advancing the Cow Protocol. Cow Protocol technology powers a network of traders and solvers, enabling trustless and efficient peer-to-peer trading. Leveraging batch auctions as a key concept uniquely positions Cow Protocol as native trading infrastructure for discrete-time settlement layers like Ethereum and enables fair and accessible trading to its users.\n\n# Vision\n\nWe foresee a future where increasingly all kinds of assets will be tokenized on Ethereum and other decentralized blockchains, where everyone - individuals and collectives - can have full custody of their tokenized assets. CowDAO's vision is a decentralized future where digital assets can be traded in a fair, efficient and reliable manner among people and communities around the world. Our mission is to build a protocol that becomes the most user friendly and price effective way to exchange digital assets, enabling all users to trade securely and know their trades are protected.\n\nWe are determined to make Cow Protocol the foundational liquidity hub for trading digital assets by applying continuous innovation, cultivating intellectual bravery and by expanding the CoW Protocol ecosystem - inviting the brightest minds to join the community.\n\n# Values and Principles\n\nThis section should not limit the scope of what CowDAO can pursue or achieve. The community should keep iterating on its values and principles to best reflect each and every member individually and the DAO as a whole.\n\nBelow are work in progress principles that we propose should guide the way we behave as a community and help shape the decision process for CowDAO.\n\n# Universal Simplicity\n\nThe goal of Cowswap is to allow easy access to the decentralized economy across all levels of experience, the Cowswap community will focus on simplicity and high quality user experience across DeFi and Web3.\n\n# Decentralization and Access to everybody\n\nCow Protocol is permissionless for anyone to access with no discrimination. The Cowswap community will reward alternative UIs and gateways to the protocol in order to ensure easy worldwide access and usability in accordance with applicable laws.\n\n# Open Collaboration\n\nCowSwap should be a core part of Ethereum and Web3, we believe this can be achieved by openly collaborating with other teams, protocols and communities in the decentralized ecosystem. Education, information sharing and aligned partnerships are key drivers to build out the CowSwap ecosystem.\n\n# Proposed Governance Parameters for CowDAO Launch\u00a0\n\n-   CowDAO proposals will be discussed on CowDAO's dedicated Forum, consisting of two phases: forum discussion and snapshot voting.\n\n-   Final approval of proposals will be made through vCOW token voting on the cow.eth snapshot space that will be deployed upon GIP-13 successfully passing.\n\n-   A maximum amount of 560M vCOW tokens will become available, out of which it\u00a0 is estimated that up to 350m vCOW tokens might\u00a0 be used\u00a0 for voting initially. A quorum is proposed that would require roughly 10%\u00a0 of this supply for approving CowDAO Improvement Proposals (CIP). This is defined by a set limit of\u00a0 35m COW tokens required to vote YES in order for a proposal to pass.\n\n-   Additionally, in order for a proposal to be approved, YES votes should account for >50% of total participating votes.

We'll offer education and collaborative research for Token Engineers specializing in Governance, the aim is to come up with Zodiac DAO Improvement proposals.\n\nAbstract\n--------\n\nIn November 2021, we'll kick-off a community research initiative on Rewards Systems and bring together 20-30 researchers from various backgrounds to work on Rewards Systems for DAOs. The work will be based on real DAO cases. We'll offer an extensive educational program and facilitate the research process to create maximum output.\\\nThis is an excellent opportunity for Gnosis Zodiac to create attention, and work collectively on Zodiac DAO Improvement Proposals.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nRewards Systems are a vital element for DAOs to compensate builders for contributions and grant decision-making power and co-ownership to those who are so critical for a DAO's value. Ecosystem Development via proposals and grants has become a popular method to distribute funds, and establish a shared perspective on value-add. All Rewards Systems need reliable value assignment, to ultimately lead to a healthy reward distribution.\n\nThe Governauts Rewards System Research initiative will explore:\n\n-   How to best track contributions and account for the richness of value adds that come in many forms: code, communication, care, creativity\n-   how to assign value, how to define value and associated roles, and permissions\n-   what do stakeholders expect from rewards, and does the system in place meet these requirements\n-   what are metrics to measure the reward system healthiness - in its respective lifecycle\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nWe'll provide education:\n\n-   case introductions:\n-   DAO cases with a Rewards System in production (TE Commons, Ocean DAO, NearDAO etc.)\n-   partner talks, incl. Zodiac\n-   Token Engineering fundamentals\n-   DAO case studies and insights from Gitcoin, CommonsStack, BlockScience, TE Commons, and more\n-   multidisciplinary insights from game design, behavioral economics, currency design, and monetary theory\n\nand mentoring:\n\n-   define an own research question in the scope of Rewards Systems\n-   use methods from the Token Engineering toolkit\n-   form multidisciplinary teams\n-   produce actual outcome\n\nThis program is open to anyone, and free.\\\nWe'll have an application process to ensure that participants\n\n-   have the right background, e.g., Political Science, Behavioral Economics, Mechanism Design or Data Analytics\n-   commit the next three months to work on Rewards System Research questions\n-   attend an education program, learn and work on a self-defined research question\n\nRationale\n---------\n\nThis program is organized by TE Academy. The mission of TE Academy is to develop the Token Engineering discipline and grow the number of skilled Token Engineers in crypto. TE Academy has run research initiatives like this several times already:\n\n-   [Gitcoin Grants Quadratic Funding\u00a02](https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/blog\/token-engineering-open-science-program-a-multidisciplinary-study-of-gitcoin-grants\/)\n-   [Balancer Simulations](https:\/\/youtu.be\/q0dmFNPDBuw)\n-   [OMNIPool Engineering and Simulations](https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL-GxJch-YeZfjcwjCwwNSRGjnSBdapOtA)\n-   About\u00a0[TE Academy Research Groups\u00a01](https:\/\/youtu.be\/_qNnVgIAmro)\n\nIncubating Governauts is an initiative to establish a dedicated branch in Token Engineering focused on decentralization and governance.\\\nWe organize workshops and discussions, provide a platform for collaboration and bring research programs to life with TE Academy.\n\nImplementation\n--------------\n\nWe'll deliver in three steps:\n\n-   Zodiac workshop:\\\n    with researchers, partners and DAO stakeholders as a roundtable to create awareness and set the scope for Zodiac DAO Improvement Proposals\n-   Research documentation:\\\n    community researchers work on Rewards Systems and\n    -   document their results in public HackMDs\/Github repos and\n    -   discuss progress in weekly sessions (all sessions are recorded and shared publicly!)\n    -   share their results in a final presentations event (public)\n-   Handover to Zodiac bounty\/grant program\\\n    to further develop most interesting results in DAO Improvement proposals\n","protocol":"gnosis","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x3b067Af83F540cB827825a6Ee5480441a4237E77","totalVotes":186,"blockNumber":13595653,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/gnosis.eth\/proposal\/0x38b7f446554911d6e0dc261b4ad4bca2ea41b83be47b1c97ce274df811ce14cd","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1636650000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637168400}","startTimestamp":1636650000,"endTimestamp":1637168400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES', 'NO']","results":"[{'total': 65640.875, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 0.21, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This, however, comes at the cost of some additional trust in the system. Primarily, GnosisDAO must trust that the GnosisDAO Safe multi-sig will faithfully execute its will on-chain.\n\nIn order to make the GnosisDAO more autonomous, we should more meaningfully give it control over its on-chain execution.\n\n## Specification\nGnosis Ltd recently developed the [DAO module](https:\/\/github.com\/gnosis\/dao-module) and [SafeSnap Snapshot Plugin](https:\/\/github.com\/snapshot-labs\/snapshot.js\/tree\/master\/src\/plugins\/daoModule).\n\nIn combination with the Gnosis Safe, this tool allows for:\n\n* Trustless and permissionless on-chain execution of arbitrary function calls\n* Continued use of our existing Snapshot strategies (ERC20 BalanceOf and Delegated ERC20 BalanceOf)\n* Cheap\/free and low friction participation for Participants.\n\n## Rationale\nAs described in the [SafeSnap announcement post](https:\/\/blog.gnosis.pm\/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f), the path to progressive decentralization can be broken down into three steps.\n\n1. **Multi-sig as a proxy:**  Gnosis Safe + Snapshot, in which the multi-sig promises to act in accordance with the off-chain votes. This is the status quo.\n2. **Multi-sig as a safeguard:**  Gnosis Safe + Snapshot + SafeSnap, in which on-chain execution of off-chain votes is handled by the SafeSnap module, but there are still multi-sig owners that can veto malicious actions or act quickly in the case of an emergency.\n3. **Look ma, no hands!:**  Gnosis Safe + Snapshot + SafeSnap, in which the multi-sig owners have been removed, and the only way to execute transactions is via the SafeSnap module.\n\nThis proposal is to move from (1) to (2) by deploying an instance of the DAO module, enabling it in the GnosisDAO Gnosis Safe, and updating the GnosisDAO Snapshot space to include the SafeSnap module.\n\n## Implementation\nThe DAO module should have the following parameters set:\n\n* **Oracle:**  GNO denominated instance of Reality.eth `0x8f1CC53bf34932591177CDA24723486205CA7510`\n* **Reality question timeout:**   `48 hours`\n* **Proposal cooldown:**   `48 hours`\n* **Proposal expiration:**   `7 days`\n* **Minimum bond:**   `10 GNO`\n* **Question Template:**  [see this document](http:\/\/gateway.pinata.cloud\/ipfs\/QmP5ptVAmAcBLJB5bpZntADLieaWRc2iN2V8UQBRoQDA56)\n* **Arbitrator:** Reality.eth contract, so that it is not possible to call arbitration\n`0x8f1CC53bf34932591177CDA24723486205CA7510`\n\n\n**Transactions that need to be executed:**\n\nOn the [`gnosis.eth`\u00a0ENS name](https:\/\/app.ens.domains\/name\/gnosis.eth):\n* update\u00a0 `snapshot` \u00a0text record to\u00a0 `ipfs:\/\/QmPdrDbYVPCz6ASgYvvYWkdpDmZ7pph7TnT4K3zhq1dfP7`\n* update\u00a0 `daorequirements` \u00a0text record to\u00a0 `ipfs:\/\/QmP5ptVAmAcBLJB5bpZntADLieaWRc2iN2V8UQBRoQDA56`\n* set\u00a0 `registrant` \u00a0and\u00a0 `controller` \u00a0to\u00a0 `0x0DA0C3e52C977Ed3cBc641fF02DD271c3ED55aFe`\n\nOn the [deployed DaoModule](0x0eBaC21F7f6A6599B5fa5f57Baaa974ADFEC4613):\n* update\u00a0 `questionArbitrator` \u00a0to\u00a0 `0x8f1CC53bf34932591177CDA24723486205CA7510`\n* update\u00a0 `minimumBond` \u00a0to\u00a0 `10 GNO`\n* update\u00a0 `questionCooldown` \u00a0to\u00a0 `48 hours`\n\nOn the [GnosisDAO's safe](http:\/\/gnosis-safe.io\/app\/#\/safes\/0x0DA0C3e52C977Ed3cBc641fF02DD271c3ED55aFe\/transactions):\n* call\u00a0 `enableModule(\"0x0eBaC21F7f6A6599B5fa5f57Baaa974ADFEC4613\")`","protocol":"gnosis","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xd714Dd60e22BbB1cbAFD0e40dE5Cfa7bBDD3F3C8","totalVotes":112,"blockNumber":12659447,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/gnosis.eth\/proposal\/QmNMRBnipvRfos9ze1MrKpFAsHqxhNrmxjrXzxJnhFif9b","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1624033800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1624638600}","startTimestamp":1624033800,"endTimestamp":1624638600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Let's do this!\", 'Make no change']","results":"[{'total': 91615.29, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

It relies on the Gnosis Safe Multisig smart contracts and Gnosis Zodiac modules for DAO governance to enable transparent governance by the GNO token holders to manage the GnosisDAO and control resources transparently. Although the GnosisDAO was seeded by Gnosis Limited, Gnosis Limited has relinquished all control over the GnosisDAO. It is participant managed, and does not have any director or manager. No single party is in control. \n\nAs the GnosisDAO exists entirely on-chain, jurisdiction may not recognise it as an entity with legal personality or limited liability. While efforts are underway (notably in Wyoming, Malta and by COALA, who have been drafting a DAO Model Law), unincorporated DAOs do not operate as persons within the eyes of the law.\n\nThe attempted shoehorning of DAOs by legal systems into existing categories such as unregistered organisations, unincorporated associations or general partnerships leads to concerns that DAO participants may be held liable for the actions of the DAO. While GnosisDAO Participants cannot dictate states and state regulators how to characterise the GnosisDAO, we should use whatever private law mechanism at our disposal to frame the GnosisDAO as we see it and minimize legal risks as much as possible to the GnosisDAO, GnosisDAO participants, Gnosis Limited as the initial funder, service providers and the signers of the GnosisDAO Safe multisig.","protocol":"gnosis","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xC42d7E776cB079C3C3b205BD307D0CdbB2431Dd3","totalVotes":116,"blockNumber":12657760,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/gnosis.eth\/proposal\/QmVdpMzXaXxWS4htWRxtux9VcaTY4zfr27xPjkoQSSEgAc","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1624017540}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1624622400}","startTimestamp":1624017540,"endTimestamp":1624622400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Let's do this!\", 'Make no change.']","results":"[{'total': 97082.125, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

It will dynamically manage the GNO rewards distribution by assigning \u201callocation points\u201d to specific markets that the GnosisDAO votes on in order to stimulate the markets with a higher participation potential or that would generate quality predictive data for the GnosisDAO. Currently, it means incentivizing mainly liquidity providers for Omen markets on xDai but the program would be open to any solution using Conditional Tokens (for example, it could also incentivize ERC20 wrapped conditional tokens on exchanges such as Uniswap, Balancer, SushiSwap, and 1inch).\n\n  \n\n# Motivation\n\nIn the current environment full of yield farming opportunities, providing capital to any protocol incurs a high opportunity cost. Moreover, prediction markets are known to be more attractive to users and more potent at predicting events when the markets are liquid and efficient enough to allow for high-scale arbitrage (cf. Vitalik Buterin [Prediction Markets: Tales from the Election](https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2021\/02\/18\/election.html) blog post).\n\nAnyone can add liquidity to prediction markets using Gnosis Conditional Tokens by minting them for existing markets or even creating their own markets. Liquidity attracts traders, trading generates prediction market fees, and ultimately this profitability attracts more liquidity. This is a flywheel effect that has to be incentivized within the Conditional Tokens ecosystem in order to position ourselves in the prediction market scene.\n\nRegardless of the venue, early liquidity providers take on more risk and opportunity costs: including contract risk, low initial profitability, etc. Moreover, conditional Tokens users should get to participate early on in deciding how the GnosisDAO evolves and plans to build new versions of the Conditional Tokens.\n\nToward this end, we propose implementing a Liquidity Mining program for prediction markets using Gnosis Conditional Tokens rewarding liquidity providers with GNO tokens. These types of initiatives are proven to attract significant amounts of capital into products and to kickstart a virtuous cycle of additional liquidity (see the examples of Balancer, Sushiswap, and 1inch) and thus improved user experience and efficiency which will, in turn, bring more usage to Conditional Tokens.\n\nThe indirect benefits of this program for the GnosisDAO are multiple:\n\n-   Fostering the use of one of Gnosis core products (CT framework).\n    \n-   Upgrading the distribution of GNO by rewarding it to valuable community members.\n    \n-   Improving the quality of data generated by prediction markets using CT.\n    \n\nThe potential direct benefits to the GnosisDAO are just waiting to be unlocked by the governance. In the future, it could take the form of the implementation of a redemption fee mechanism embedded into the Conditional Tokens framework, or of a trading fee in exchanges controlled by the GnosisDAO. Legacy prediction markets like PredictIt charge significant fees (10% of the profit on a market and 5% of withdrawals), blockchain prediction markets like Augur or Cover charge a smaller redemption fee (~1% for Augur and 0.1% for Cover). As long as the GnosisDAO provides continuous support and development for Conditional Token, a small fee will probably be accepted by the users.\n\nIt would also be possible for the GnosisDAO to find novel revenue sources around Conditional Tokens. For example, frontends controlled by the GnosisDAO could also allow users to burn some GNO in order to have their markets displayed in more attractive positions of the UI.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe GnosisDAO liquidity mining program for prediction markets using Conditional Tokens will be inspired by Balancer and SushiSwap liquidity mining programs.\n\n  \n\nFor the first year 120,000 GNO tokens, or 10,000 per month, will be distributed to liquidity providers staking their conditional tokens liquidity into the GnosisDAO liquidity mining contracts. For networks other than Ethereum mainnet (in particular xDAI), those GNO tokens would be wrapped on the particular network.\n\n  \n\nThe amount of GNO distributed to a particular liquidity pool will be determined by an allocation point system. The GNO will be distributed between pools in proportion to their allocation points and within pools in proportion to participant liquidity.  \n  \n\nFor example let\u2019s assume there are 3 pools A, B, and C with 100, 400, and 500 allocation points, Alice has 200 ETH of liquidity in pool A which has a total of 500 ETH of liquidity.

The current implementation of Gnosis Impact has known flaws and poses uncalled-for obstacles to pass proposals through the governance process. I therefore propose to exclude the obligatory utilization of Gnosis Impact as part of the GnosisDAO\u2019s governance process phase 3 until a proposal passes amending its shortcomings.\n\n\nThe Proposal\n\nThe GnosisDAO governance process currently consists of three phases:\n1.    Informal discussion on Gnosis Forum regarding potential proposal\n2.   Creation of a GIP in the Gnosis Forum, including a Forum poll\n3.   Creation of proposal on Snapshot + creation of two prediction markets on Omen, with one market collateralized in GNO and the other collateralized in a stablecoin + setting up the Gnosis Impact plugin.\n\nAs described above, phase 3 of the GnosisDAO Governance process is complex and cost intensive, making it less attractive and accessible for individuals to move their proposal forward to the final and essential governance stage that will decide on the implementation of a proposal.\n\nOther than the complexity of setting up Gnosis Impact, the tool itself currently has a few inherent flaws:\n- Due to Omen\u2019s Fixed Product Market Maker (FPMM), all funds provided to set up the prediction markets are lost: once it becomes clear how the vote will turn out traders will buy all the winning tokens. This is making any proposal very cost intensive.\n- As setting up Gnosis Impact is very capital intensive, it is not worthwhile to process any proposal that involves less than $100k. \n- Price impacts projected by Gnosis Impact are not very accurate as a) the market prices for the outcome tokens can only be found as long as it is still open which decision will be made on Snapshot and b) because potential profit opportunities are debilitated by Omen fees and gas fees. \n\nOnly two proposals have so far been processed through phase 3 since GnosisDAO went live in November of last year, underlining the complexity of passing proposals through the final stage. Removing Gnosis Impact as a mandatory step will make GnosisDAO\u2019s governance process simpler and economically viable and will allow more individuals to push their proposal to the final stage of governance.","protocol":"gnosis","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x28eFf6Ece9d2f1e0B5E18D34b50E01a0c91d0c99","totalVotes":39,"blockNumber":11866721,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/gnosis.eth\/proposal\/QmfEpoQtvjWMeRwfeFvothLDkFqaXCZNHU9ZFb3S3cuLRU","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1613455200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1613754000}","startTimestamp":1613455200,"endTimestamp":1613754000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Remove Gnosis Impact', 'Make Gnosis Impact optional', 'Make no changes']","results":"[{'total': 61185.64, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 840.176, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

For example, a safe that holds 100 GNO and casts a vote for this (or any other) GIP proposal, within the time limit, would receive 5 GNO tokens in the merkledrop.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to immediately activate existing and new GNO token holders to become active in GnosisDAO governance decisions. This proposal would also help to further distribute GNO tokens in the community.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe merkledrop will use an instance of Balancer Labs' [erc20-redeemable contracts](https:\/\/github.com\/balancer-labs\/erc20-redeemable\/tree\/master\/merkle) and an instance of Balancer Labs' [claim interface](https:\/\/claim.balancer.finance\/#\/).\n\nMore detail will be added to the specification as becomes available.\n\n## Rationale\n\nA merkledrop should be used, as opposed to other designs, so as to reduce the upfront gas cost and to require recipients to actively claim their bonus tokens.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe plans outlined in this proposal are subject to discussion and change.

The goal is to incentivize liquidity provision on the Senior class of the Perpetual Yield Tranches while aligning LPs and $IDLE token holders.\n\nThe approval of the proposal will empower Development League to build the smart contract infrastructure and transfer 178,200 $IDLE from the IdleController to the IdleGaugesFund contract.\n\nWith the launch of Gauges, Idle protocol will distribute $IDLE to Best Yield (BY) pools via IdleController and to Perpetual Yield Tranches (PYT) via Gauge Voting. The overall $IDLE emission rate will not change (3,300 $IDLE\/day).\n\n### Motivation\n\nIdle DAO has [already implemented](https:\/\/gov.idle.finance\/t\/single-idle-staking\/503) stkIDLE minting (locking system) and the fee-sharing mechanism.\n\nThis proposal aims to set up two additional features: Gauge Voting and Farming Boost.\n\n**By integrating the Gauge Voting and Farming Boost modules, token holders that lock their $IDLE (minting stkIDLE) will be able to vote on PYT $IDLE allocation and also boost their individual rewards.**\n\nIn the beginning, only the Senior class of PYT will be eligible to receive Gauges incentives.\nThat class receives a smaller share of the underlying yield due to the coverage protection they receive, and $IDLE farming would stimulate further liquidity deployment in this class of tranches.\n\n*Benefits*\n* Less $IDLE circulating supply due to more locked tokens\n* Development of $IDLE booster vaults by other protocols\n* New $IDLE-based products\n* Protocols accumulating accrued $IDLE\n* Alignment between LPs and $IDLE token holders\n* DAO2DAO collaborations, with protocols fostering token holders to vote for their PYT\n\n*Tokenomics Specifications*\nThe Idle protocol currently distributes about 3,300 $IDLE per day, 1.2m $IDLE per year.\nIdle Best-Yield on Ethereum represents the main Idle product today, and it\u2019s the place where most of the TVL is located; thus, it\u2019s crucial to not drastically influence returns for current LPs.\n\nThis proposal routes 30% of the $IDLE allocated to the [liquidity mining program](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x275da8e61ea8e02d51edd8d0dc5c0e62b4cdb0be) into Gauges for 6 months, resulting in 990 $IDLE\/day distributed over a semester (178,200 $IDLE in total).\n\nThe Best-Yield reward reduction represents a minor component of the yield generated via Idle protocol, while that amount would empower Idle to sustain Gauges funding.\n\n*Technical Specifications*\nThe system would consist of the following smart contracts, as in Curve Finance:\n* LiquidityGauge: measuring liquidity provided by users over time.\n* GaugeController: maintaining a list of gauges and respective weights.\n* IdleDistributor: forked from Curve\u2019s Minter, it will be slightly modified.\n* IdleGaugesFund: holding and releasing $IDLE tokens on IdleDistributor request. This component will also maintain parameters for $IDLE distribution to Gauges.\n\nThe main difference between the Idle Gauge system and the Curve Gauge System is in the IdleGaugesFund that replaces the CRV token (that encodes the release schedule).\n\nA scheme of the potential Idle Gauge system is reported below.\n![](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard11\/uploads\/idle\/original\/1X\/5108c5994e10e7f049a2d4f8a61d16b6d7cbc8f4.jpeg)\n\nA detailed description of motivation, specifications, and final considerations is available in the [forum post](https:\/\/gov.idle.finance\/t\/introducing-idle-gauges-model-for-tranches\/913).\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve $IDLE Gauges for Tranches\n**AGAINST**: Vote against $IDLE Gauges for Tranches\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o\/edit?usp=sharing).\n","protocol":"idlefinance","adapter":"snapshot","proposer":"0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540","totalVotes":7,"blockNumber":14095422,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/idlefinance.eth\/proposal\/0x9aca2140aa3c98419eea8751ccfe26d2823d2311251ee5d8b1cbf7591e6409af","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643389200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643734800}","startTimestamp":1643389200,"endTimestamp":1643734800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST', 'DISCUSS MORE']","results":"[{'total': 256922.08, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Furthermore, the DAO will increase the robustness of Uni v3 oracle, allowing more users to safely interact with $IDLE lending platforms.\n \nIf the proposal passes the Temperature Check, it will be merged with the next IIP.\n### Motivation\nBancor deployed the first-ever automated market makers (AMMs) on Ethereum in 2017, and currently manages [$1.3b in total liquidity](https:\/\/app.bancor.network\/pools). Bancor Protocol was audited [multiple times](https:\/\/docs.bancor.network\/ethereum-contracts\/security), and its DAO launched a $100k [bug bounty program](https:\/\/immunefi.com\/bounty\/bancor\/) via Immunefi.\n \nThe IDLE\/BNT pool had $100k in liquidity, half in IDLE and half in BNT. Bancor DAO [increased the depth of the pool to 250K BNT](https:\/\/gov.bancor.network\/t\/proposal-increase-trading-liquidity-limit-to-250k-bnt-on-the-idle-bnt-pool\/3275). \n \nThis proposal aims to deploy 187k IDLE from the current Smart treasury ([Balancer pool](https:\/\/pools.balancer.exchange\/#\/pool\/0xcaf467dfe064a1f54e4ece8515ddf326b9be801e\/about)) to the IDLE\/BNT pool and earn a yield from that deposit.\n \nA larger IDLE\/BNT pool will result in having approximately 2x the liquidity currently held in [Sushi IDLE\/WETH pool](https:\/\/analytics.sushi.com\/pairs\/0xa7f11e026a0af768d285360a855f2bded3047530), without the burden of incentivizing liquidity provision (Idle DAO already distributed 180k IDLE during a 6-month program) or owning the other asset of the pair.\nThe expected slippage reduction will be extended to Paraswap too, as the DEX aggregator will simultaneously route the funds across multiple AMMs.\n \nWith the upcoming [Bancor V3](https:\/\/try.bancor.network\/), there will be no cap on liquidity deployment, and the platform will also enable auto compounding rewards and instant impermanent loss protection.\nThe 10% fee stream routed into the Smart treasury will be addressed to FeeTreasury, increasing its share to 20% of total performance revenues.\n \nBancor features and expected slippage reduction are detailed in the [forum proposal](https:\/\/gov.idle.finance\/t\/remove-idle-smart-treasury-and-deploy-200k-idle-into-bancor-and-uni-v3\/885).\n\n*Uni V3 Full-range liquidity deployment*\n14 WETH and equivalent IDLE value (~23k IDLE at the time of writing) now sitting into the Balancer pool will be deployed in UNI v3, covering the full price range. Idle DAO already funded UNI v3 pool with $120k in October, unlocking the Fuse listing. That oracle is currently used by Euler too, lending primitive with isolated markets. More liquidity into the Uni v3 will strengthen the oracle resiliency against manipulation attacks.\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Bancor and Uni v3 liquidity deployment\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Bancor and Uni v3 liquidity deployment\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o\/edit?usp=sharing).\n ","protocol":"idlefinance","adapter":"snapshot","proposer":"0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540","totalVotes":4,"blockNumber":13978803,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/idlefinance.eth\/proposal\/0xfe0f77b654d8822f5a3607187a903fd8b7be2a9fe18ee572f7b55e9d032bb2f7","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641837600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642096800}","startTimestamp":1641837600,"endTimestamp":1642096800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST', 'DISCUSS MORE']","results":"[{'total': 70941.84, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

As reported in the [Medium article](https:\/\/idlefinance.medium.com\/potential-vulnerability-disclosure-2021-11-18-9bc0a2cdc0f2), this vulnerability could have put funds of Idle Protocol\u2019s integrators at risk.\n\nEnzyme has an active bug bounty program launched on [Immunefi](https:\/\/immunefi.com\/bounty\/enzymefinance\/). Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System. All payouts are done by the Enzyme Finance team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in USDC up to $400,000.\n\nThe final reward amount for critical smart contract vulnerabilities is capped at 10% of the funds at risk based on the vulnerability reported. In this case, the issue would have impacted 3 vaults on Enzyme and up to $400k worth of funds.\n\nDue to the quality and professionalism of the report and the potential\/scope of the issue as well, they found it inappropriate to pay out less than their \u201chigh\u201d tier ($80k). For this reason, Enzyme rewarded the bug hunter with $90k.\n\nFollowing this payout, Idle Leagues proposes to indemnify Enzyme with 6250 $IDLE ($25k using [20-day average rate](https:\/\/dune.xyz\/idle.finance\/dollarIDLE-20-day-Rolling-Price)).\n\n\n### Details\n\nActions:\n* Send 6250 $IDLE from Ecosystem Fund to Enzyme wallet: 1 action\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Enzyme Bug Bounty Cooperation\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Enzyme Bug Bounty Cooperation\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o\/edit?usp=sharing).\n","protocol":"idlefinance","adapter":"snapshot","proposer":"0x2fa92128ecE3901395448bf62Dd5Ff6a35871540","totalVotes":3,"blockNumber":13690462,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/idlefinance.eth\/proposal\/0x89282f85e0074a46f660bc7a5651c702dfaa9745d6ed4c3fffb16360b6e32ea4","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637938800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1638212400}","startTimestamp":1637938800,"endTimestamp":1638212400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST', 'DISCUSS MORE']","results":"[{'total': 121996.33, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

JPG provides exposure to the top NFTs through a single liquid token. ![|624x429](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard10\/uploads\/theindexdao\/optimized\/2X\/9\/98915cc09dffe55d7e329b3da46ddae8f6916a67_2_624x429.png)\n\n# 2.0 Abstract\n\nJPG is a index token of blue-chip and premier NFT collections. The index is composed of fungible versions of NFTs including fractional and liquidity vault tokens, curation DAO tokens, NFT currencies, and wrapped NFTs.The JPG token can be implemented using the simple (aka composite) Set Protocol with a medium amount of additional engineering effort.\n\n## 2.1 Motivation\n\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a revolutionary cultural, artistic, and financial phenomenon. However, despite the massive size and growth of the NFT market there is no NFT index token.\n\nFor institutional investors, benefits of an NFT index token include access to a highly illiquid and fragmented market, a single instrument for long\/short positions, enhanced diversification, faster order fulfillment, reduced transaction fees, and automatic rebalancing. Advantages for retail investors, in addition to the above, include easier onboarding, mitigating unit bias, and lower capital entry requirements.\n\n## 2.2 Rationale\n\nJPG is designed to provide liquid access to the top NFT collections through a \u2018simple\u2019 Set index token. The tokens are drawn from fractional and liquidity vaults, curation DAOs, and currencies. The tokens were selected based on having high liquidity and sufficiently high market cap. The allocation uses a very high liquidity weighting to minimize the price impact and transaction costs for issuance, minting and redeeming.\n\nIn general, there are 4 ways to make NFTs liquid: liquidity vaults, fractional vaults, collection DAOs, and wrappers. Liquidity vaults (eg NFTX, NFT20) let you exchange your NFT for tokens and vice versa. NFTX vault tokens are termed vTokens. Fractional vaults (eg Fractional, SZNS, Unicly) let you turn an NFT or collection into tokens but then require an auction to sell the NFTs. Collection DAOs (eg WHALE, uJENNY, BPT, FISH, APED and many others) have membership tokens, the value of which is backed by the DAO vault. And wrappers (eg WGK, WG0) let you wrap your NFT and receive tokens in exchange.\n\nFeedback from the community included the following points:\n\n* \u2018Launch with a simple index.\u2019 Based on this feedback we have decided to launch with a simple index that requires only medium engineering effort according to EWG. We have deferred the ability to trade NFTs directly and restricted ourselves to ERC-20 tokens which provide NFT exposure. We have also relaxed our inclusion criteria to include not only fractional and liquidity vaults, but also curation DAOs, and wrapped NFTs. This has had the added benefit of dramatically improving the underlying liquidity. The sole engineering request is to add support for claiming the ETH from auction proceeds.\n* \u2018Allocate 10% to Ether\u2019. We have added a 10% allocation to Ether based on a recommendation from @overanalyser. This allocation serves to reduce the price impact at issuance. Additionally, it provides a reserve for acquiring future tokens without incurring the price impact of selling a low-liquidity position. The index may also acquire Ether in the future following a successful auction of a fractional vault.\n* \u2018The maintenance costs will be very high because of the low underlying liquidity.\u2019\u2019 To address this we have heavily optimized the token inclusion criteria and weighting for liquidity. Also, we have removed rebalancing and dramatically reduced the recomposition frequency in order to minimize the associated AUM decay and gas costs. As a result the maintenance costs will be minimal.\n* \u2018There are not enough vaults from the Fractional protocol.\u2019 The Fractional vaults tend to have very low liquidity. Only 2 Fractional vaults (i.e., DOG and NFD) met our liquidity requirements and so were included in the index. We will monitor new Fractional vaults for future inclusion in the index.\n* \u2018Consider using synthetics.\u2019 We are open to using synthetics provided they satisfy the inclusion criteria. The only potential synthetic is $uPunks from Yam Synths. However, this token has negligible liquidity and expires monthly so it would be very expensive to constantly rotate.\n\n","protocol":"indexCoop","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xECbe3854B26750B301341BAD149185E55544aBA1","totalVotes":57,"blockNumber":14160084,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/index-coop.eth\/proposal\/0x8ca3ebba5277d3f21dc4bf2c6c62017fe8c6ff50b67c640c2d2e99007a526c74","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644256800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644516000}","startTimestamp":1644256800,"endTimestamp":1644516000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST']","results":"[{'total': 304352.6, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Realizing that too broad of a composite index may run the risk of not addressing a clear target audience it was decided to separate out these three tranches into their own indices. Doing so will enable users to create a portfolio according to their unique risk tolerance and yield demand. The low-risk and medium-risk tranches are now PINT (Pulse INTerest Index) and PAY (Pulse Aggregate Yield Index) respectively.\n\nAll Pulse Yield products follow the same core design elements to capture the best risk adjusted yield on USD stablecoins within DeFi. Yield is aggregated across DeFi into a single ERC20 token that can be easily traded. As yield accumulates, the price of the PINT and PAY token steadily increases.\n\n# Motivation\nYield indices appeal to investors seeking to hold a portion of their portfolio in USD stablecoins. PINT is designed for investors who seek as part of their asset allocation a yield aggregating product that only uses the safest yield sources in DeFi \u2013 whether based on risk management or liquidity considerations. PAY on the other hand is more suited to investors who are comfortable with additional protocol risk in order to achieve double-digit annual yields using stablecoins. The potential to create and maintain a third index with significantly higher yield, risk, and turnover is left for future development, as well as variations on other networks.\n\nPulse Yield products are designed for holders to passively earn and compound stablecoin yields. By buying the respective token, holders eliminate the problem of having to maintain a diversified productive stablecoin portfolio that includes costly rebalancing and reinvesting of non-stablecoin incentives. For those of us who like the simplicity of holding a single position, PINT and PAY will become the go to ERC20 token.\n\nBy being a basket index of selected yield opportunities, PINT and PAY solve many problems for yield seeking investors:\n\n* Not enough time to keep up with the fast paced DeFi ecosystem\n* Difficulty to accurately comprehend and understand the various risks associated with each product\n* Which yield opportunities to invest in to maximise returns given the associated risks\n\nFor DAO treasuries, fund managers, and retail investors alike, the Pulse Yield product offering allows them to gain access to a diversified productive stablecoin portfolio in a single transaction.\n\nThe launch of products with distinct risk profiles allows investors to create custom portfolios based on their own risk budget by combining PINT and PAY. This use case is particularly appealing to DAOs seeking to diversify a portion of their treasury and that may have liabilities with different durations. DAOs do not have to spend time and effort on the yield opportunity selection process and can instead focus on larger asset allocation decisions.\n\nIt is worth noting that even the yields expected from the low-risk PINT product are higher by an order of magnitude compared to US TradFi yield products such as CDs or savings accounts.\n\n## Index Coop - Core Value Proposition\nPulse Yield products provide a unique opportunity to introduce tokenized yield aggregation by simplifying the user experience \u2013 just like FLIs did for leverage products.\n\nKey reasons for Index Coop to launch PINT and PAY:\n* Offer a product targeting the fast growing stablecoin market\n* Diversify revenue with the inclusion of a market cycle neutral product\n* Build integrations \/ relationships with DAO treasuries\n* Address a new user base of yield focused investors\n* Pioneer the first tokenized yield aggregator in DeFi\n* Offer a compelling product for yield starved TradFi investors\n\n","protocol":"indexCoop","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xECbe3854B26750B301341BAD149185E55544aBA1","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":14159900,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/index-coop.eth\/proposal\/0x78df7c22e2f7138746ca0ac624eb053d69122454b99e30370cef29542f96a203","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644256800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644516000}","startTimestamp":1644256800,"endTimestamp":1644516000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

This process was necessary when Index Coop first launched to ensure it devoted effort on products the community thought would be successful. The new PWG onboarding process provides a higher degree of confidence that the products being built will help IC achieve its organizational goals. Because of this, we request that the DG1 step be eliminated from the onboarding process.\n\nIn some circumstances a batch of products may be put through this process if things like market opportunity, technical requirements and launch parameters are similar. An example of this would be the FLI products.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWhen Index Cooperative launched it didn\u2019t have a robust product department performing standard functions such as:\n\n* Managing a roadmap and backlog of product ideas\n* Brainstorming product ideas\n* Performing market research\n* Developing a long-term strategy (eg which products should we focus in 3, 6, and 12 months)\n* Analyzing underlying liquidity for feasibility\n* Performing in-depth technical analysis to develop product solutions\n* Engaging with external protocols to build innovative products\n* Maintaining Profit & Loss (P&L) metrics\n  * This is a new capability we\u2019re spinning up to ensure each product has a profitability roadmap.\n  * For reference, at DPI\u2019s currently AUM it would take ~7 years to recuperate operational cost required to grow the product\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs we take more ownership of our onboarding process we have a higher degree of certainty over the success of each product. We also don\u2019t have as many financial negotiations (fee split, capital spend, etc.) that varied drastically and required community feedback.\n\nIn order to streamline the onboarding process we\u2019d like to remove some of the overhead required to get products out the door. Each product will still go through a rigorous review but most of this work will now be completed prior to being presented to the IC community.\n\n## Rationale\n\nOur pod and PWG team have gained the skills and have set up the process necessary to ensure the highest quality products make it to market.\n\nSome functions that might have required additional community approval, such as liquidity spend and fee splits, have been largely taken out of the product process. The liquidity pod now manages the capital spend necessary to launch products. The Compensation Framework also outlines the standard fee split to individuals working directly on each product. The only negotiation piece is the fee split with branding partners, which we would also like to standardize.\n\nRemoving DG1 allows the team to spend more time focusing on the critical pieces of the onboarding process rather than supporting two decision gates by the community.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe original onboarding process was necessary because we needed a way to vet product ideas before considerable effort is being spent to develop each product. When an external methodologist would approach us with a product idea, we had no idea how successful a potential product would be in our portfolio.\n\nDG1 was a way to approve or reject a product idea before all aspects of development were researched. PWG was on the hook for all work pre- and post-DG1\n\nThe old onboarding process looks as follows\n\n* Agree on Commercials with methodologist to establish the fee split, where to launch, how much capital is required to launch and how much to spend on incentives\n1.

This is intended to be for the sole purpose of submitting 3 AIPs and for voting said AIPs. The first AIP will re-enable the borrowing of DPI on Aave V2, as well as several other Aave Treasury maintenance actions. The second AIP will propose the listing of DPI on the Aave ARC Market, to bolster the institutional adoption of DPI. The third AIP will propose changes to the AVAX Aave Market parameters enabling us to launch AVAX2x-FLI.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAll Aave voting rights are to be delegated to an EOA controlled by the IndexCoop development team to submit the 3 AIPs.\n\nBy delegating to an EOA address, the IndexCoop Dev Team will be able to submit the 3 AIPs, the first after review by the Aave DAO, IndexCoop and Llama Community teams, the second after review by IndexCoop, Fireblocks and Aave DAO, and the third after review by IndeCoop, Aave DAO and Ava Labs. The submission must be performed from an EOA address and can not be performed from a multisig address. IndexCoop engineering will review any AIP an additional time prior to submission, as per convention.\n\nAfter the voting process for these AIPs has been completed the delegation power will revert back to its current configuration which is the standard multi-sig wallet for all IndexCoop assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEven more important than the ability to vote, is the ability to put forward proposals. Proposals can only be put forward by an EOA address. Thus the need for the IndexCoop\u2019s Aave holding proposal power to be delegated to an EOA address.\n\nIn order to submit an AIP, a minimum number of votes is needed to meet the [proposal power](https:\/\/docs.aave.com\/governance\/) requirement for creating and sustaining a proposal. To propose on Aave, we need 80,000 votes to meet the proposal power requirement.\n\nIndexCoop holds roughly 100,000 AAVE votes.\n\n## Specification\n\nIndexCoop multi-sig wallet delegates the Aave voting power to an ethereum address controlled by IndexCoop Dev Team which is then to be used for submitting the AIPs.\n\n## Vote\n\n**FOR**\n\n* Delegate Aave voting power from the IndexCoop Multisig address to IndexCoop Dev Team\u2019s EOA.\n\n**AGAINST**\n\n* Do not delegate Aave voting power from the IndexCoop Multisig address to IndexCoop Dev Team\u2019s EOA.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).","protocol":"indexCoop","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc2971FE806CE4438dA09e21fC7be7FB121Cf7e13","totalVotes":61,"blockNumber":14115402,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/index-coop.eth\/proposal\/0xd06999443c306b95307c40f4dd932c462962959201ec0c335700a154b599016d","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643738400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643997600}","startTimestamp":1643738400,"endTimestamp":1643997600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST']","results":"[{'total': 135275.6, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

The product is receiving data from and being advised by L2BEAT, the leading analytics and research platform for Ethereum layer two (L2) scaling.\n\n[Most recent composition.](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-127-launch-the-layer-2-index-layer2\/3630\/7?u=mringz)\n\n# 2.0 Abstract\n\nLayer 2 (L2) blockchains are a ground-breaking innovation in cryptocurrency. L2 chains provide transactions which are orders of magnitude faster, less expensive, and higher throughput than their L1 counterparts. The extremely high performance of L2 chains will be instrumental in onboarding the next generation of mainstream users to crypto. Additionally, the dramatically faster speed and lower transaction costs enable a wide range of applications not currently possible on decentralized L1 chains such as real-time gaming, high-frequency trading, micro-trading, perpetuals, and central limit order books. It is anticipated that most applications will eventually move to L2 with L1 serving as a settlement layer.\n\nThe LAYER2 index token will capture the leading protocols in the L2 revolution. The protocols include infrastructure, scaling, and application tokens. The index is receiving data from and being advised by [L2BEAT](https:\/\/l2beat.com\/), the leading L2 analytics dashboard and educational resource.\n\n![|260x463](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard10\/uploads\/theindexdao\/original\/2X\/8\/8355714a8e291be3ea48d5128bfec17bfe402a9d.png)\n\n## 2.1 Motivation\n\nL2 protocols represent one of the most dynamic and promising segments of the cryptocurrency market. In the Index Coop\u2019s most recent market research surveys, an L2 index token featured as one of the most requested products. The LAYER2 token can address that market demand.

MCAP will be the first non-synthetic total crypto market cap token.\n\n# 2.0 Abstract\n\nMCAP is an index token that tracks the total crypto market capitalization. The token uses a sampling approach to represent the total market cap using a subset of large cap tokens. The product can be implemented as a Simple set with no additional engineering effort. The components are among the most liquid on the market so the NAV decay and gas costs will be minimal.\n\n## 2.1 Motivation\n\nTotal market cap indices are the bedrock of passive investing. There is approximately $2B total AUM in centralized large cap crypto index funds. However, there are few decentralized total market index tokens and all of them are synthetic. Providing a total market cap index would address the largest segment of the index market and serve as a foundation for future diversified meta-index products.\n\n## 2.2 Rationale\n\nMCAP uses sampling replication to represent the total crypto market cap. In the sampling method, the weights are selected to maximally explain the total market variation. Sampling is a standard method in designing traditional equity index funds but we believe this is the first application to crypto. Advantages of sampling techniques over synthetic methods include full collateralization, no de-pegging risk, transparency, and ease of communication. The main weakness is the inability to capture variability which is outside of and uncorrelated with the sample.\n","protocol":"indexCoop","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xECbe3854B26750B301341BAD149185E55544aBA1","totalVotes":38,"blockNumber":14068205,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/index-coop.eth\/proposal\/0xea97cbdd8df6d3b5e002bd6019c10c9f7ed983652d62886985ffc29e68aa980f","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643047200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643306400}","startTimestamp":1643047200,"endTimestamp":1643306400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST']","results":"[{'total': 43430.742, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 191778.7, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Reports are to be provided monthly as we endeavor to keep the community informed of our actions and share our learnings.\n\n# Motivation\n\nManaging the DEX liquidity of $INDEX and our products is a key part of our operations. If done correctly, it greatly improves the user experience when buying and holding our tokens.\n\nTo date, liquidity has been managed by either expenditure (liquidity mining) or the direct provision of liquidity,implemented on an individual basis via the IIP process. With the creation of a dedicated Liquidity Pod, Index Coop has already delegated authority to a select group to act in the communities best interest in a more streamlined manner, maximising operational efficiency.\n\nThe Liquidity Pod has the ability to make decisions relating to the liquidity of INDEX and Index Coop\u2019s products. However, the pod needs a dedicated amount of capital and to know it will be made available whenever it is needed.\n\nThe current table below shows the status of past, current and pending deployments from the Operations Account at the Liquidity Pod\u2019s request.\n\n|Product|Type|Value Deployed|Notes|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|BED:ETH|Long term (>90 day)|$270 k|[NFT](https:\/\/app.uniswap.org\/#\/pool\/141348) (Current $220 k)|\n|ETH2-FLI:ETH (polygon)|Seed (< 7 day)|$250 k|[Already closed](https:\/\/polygonscan.com\/address\/0xdecc5b013c74d8d3cef1f8918768dda17490b505) ($180 k)|\n|INDEX:ETH|Long term (> 90 day)|$1,400,000|[IIP-109](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/proposed-iip-109-deploy-protocol-owned-index-eth-liquidity-into-managed-visor-vault-on-uniswap-v3\/3238)|\n|GMI:ETH|Growth (~30 day) |$400 k |[NFT Position ](https:\/\/app.uniswap.org\/#\/pool\/179163)1 ($220 k)  [NFT Position 2](https:\/\/app.uniswap.org\/#\/pool\/179170) ($178 k)|\n\n**Please note** there are risks with deploying community capital to provide liquidity. Some of these risks are detailed below:\n\n* Price exposure to volatile assets (typically ETH, wBTC and our products)\n* Impermanent loss (IL) due to price divergence within an LP position - when using concentrated liquidity, this is greater than the less capital efficient full range DEX positions.\n* Price impact costs to issue \/ redeem products\n* Gas costs\n* Time costs to monitor and manage positions\n\nIt is worth noting that LP positions are considered a high risk asset allocation within the broader pool of community capital. Finance Nest will need to reflect this in how other community funds are managed.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Funding Request\n\nThe Liquidity Pod will be given dedicated funding to be held across the Index Coop Operation Accounts on the various networks that support INDEX and Index Coop product liquidity. The funds are to be administered by the Operations Account signers at the request of the Liquidity Pod.\n\nThe Operations Account provides the Liquidity Pod access to a safe operational multisig that will soon have the added benefit of [crisis management](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-xy-finance-nest-autonomy-act\/3646) funding needs. Liquidity Pod also gains the advantage of having a network of already established multi-sigs across the various networks Index Coop operates.\n\nTo support the ongoing liquidity needs of INDEX and Index Coop\u2019s products, the Liquidity Pod requests $5M in initial capital to support ongoing operations. With $1.97M already deployed, this represents an additional $3.03M in funding.\n\nCurrently, the community holds around $838K of the $3.03M being requested. Rather than use stables to fund liquidity positions, Liquidity Pod will use future revenue to bridge the immediate funding gap. Index Coop earned on average $400K for each of the last four months of 2021. Liquidity Pod will draw on Index Coop\u2019s revenue until the $5M of capital is made available. It is not ideal to use stable coins to fund the higher volatility liquidity positions, unless it is absolutely necessary. However for low volatility assets like [PINT and PAY](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-xx-launch-of-pulse-yield-products-pint-pay-dg2\/3608) this remains a valid option as it could be considered a productive stable asset position.\n\n## Why $5M ?\n\nFLI products are going to be launched in waves. The next wave of FLI products could be as many as five at one time, the four mentioned [here](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-119-launch-imatic-ieth-btc2x-ibtc-flis-on-polygon\/3478) and [MATIC2x-FLI-P](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-105-launch-matic2x-fli-polygon\/3186). This is around $1.25M of the $3.03M. With DATA, LDI, PAY & PINT plus others in the pipeline that may also require liquidity the remaining balance is $445K per product. Some products require more than this and others less. After looking at various options, the Liquidity Pods feels the $5M request is sufficient funding in the short term before reassessing towards the end of H1 2022.\n\nThe Liquidity Pod at this point in time expects PCL to be an ongoing need of Index Coop\u2019s and for funds to be rolled from one position into the next as we look forward to launching products more frequently during 2022. We are still actively determining how best to exit positions and will be doing a lot of work in this area going forward so we can optimise how the communities capital can be deployed.\n\nTo help communicate how LPs are determined and managed, the Liquidity Pod will be publishing guidelines to outline the remit and considerations driving Liquidity Pod decisions and fund management.\n\nTo make sure the community is well informed, the analysis and performance of the liquidity pod will be shared monthly on the governance forum. This shall provide the community with insights into how the liquidity pod is performing. Keeping with the new Nest and Pod model, Liquidity Pod will create and track performance with the use of OKRs.\n\n# Voting\n\n### For\n\nDo make available $5M worth of capital to the Liquidity Pod for supporting on-chain liquidity deployments of INDEX and Index Coop products.\n\n### Against\n\nDo Not make available $5M worth of capital to the Liquidity Pod for supporting on-chain liquidity deployments of INDEX and Index Coop products.\n\n# Copyright\nCopyright and related rights waived via[ CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).","protocol":"indexCoop","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc2971FE806CE4438dA09e21fC7be7FB121Cf7e13","totalVotes":37,"blockNumber":14067245,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/index-coop.eth\/proposal\/0x26c5290b6f8ae2e92238e7fad455128d1bdab90ba90f235bf584eb87d8e33a9a","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643047200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643306400}","startTimestamp":1643047200,"endTimestamp":1643306400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST']","results":"[{'total': 246150, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Proposals usually have to spend a minumum of 48 hours in discussion on the forum.*\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis IIP requests authorization for Index Coop to delegate all of IndexCoop's AAVE voting rights to an External Owned Account (EOA). This is intended to be for the sole purpose of submitting an AIP and for voting said AIP. This AIP will list several new assets as collateral on the Aave Polygon Market, including DPI. Additionally it will change several risk parameters, namely MATIC, enabling us to safely launch MATIC2x-FLI.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAll Aave voting rights are to be delegated to the following address:\n\n`0xC3c2e1Cf099Bc6e1fA94ce358562BCbD5cc59FE5`\n\nBy delegating to an EOA address, coderdan.eth, an engineer with Aavegotchi who has worked on this AIP, will be able to submit an Aave DAO, IndexCoop and Aavegotchi  reviewed AIP. The submission must be performed from an EOA address and can not be performed from a multisig address. IndexCoop engineering will review the AIP an additional time prior to delegation and submission. \n\nUpon voting the delegation power will revert back to its current configuration which is the standard multi-sig wallet for all IndexCoop assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nEven more important than the ability to vote, is the ability to put forward proposals. Proposals can only be put forward by an EOA address. Thus the need for the IndexCoop's Aave holding proposal power to be delegated to an EOA address.\n\nIn order to submit an AIP, a minimum number of votes is needed to meet the [proposal power](https:\/\/docs.aave.com\/governance\/) requirement for creating and sustaining a proposal. To propose on Aave, we need 80,000 votes to meet the proposal power requirement.\n\nAs of block 14020108 (Jan-17-2022 01:30:28 AM UTC), IndexCoop holds roughly 105,000 AAVE votes.\n\n## Specification\n\nIndexCoop multi-sig wallet delegates the Aave voting power to an ethereum address: `0xC3c2e1Cf099Bc6e1fA94ce358562BCbD5cc59FE5` which is then to be used for submitting the AIP proposal enabling a number of changes to the Aave Polygon Market including adding DPI, and adjusting the MATC risk parameter change to enable MATC2x-FLI to be launched.\n\n## Vote\n\n**FOR**\n\n* Delegate Aave voting power from the IndexCoop Multisig address to `0xC3c2e1Cf099Bc6e1fA94ce358562BCbD5cc59FE5`.\n\n**AGAINST**\n\n* Do not delegate Aave voting power from the IndexCoop Multisig address to `0xC3c2e1Cf099Bc6e1fA94ce358562BCbD5cc59FE5`.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).","protocol":"indexCoop","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc2971FE806CE4438dA09e21fC7be7FB121Cf7e13","totalVotes":43,"blockNumber":14025647,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/index-coop.eth\/proposal\/0xa69b79826d8dbd9290c9eec41ef11cfd15621c44e277ff3eb5a24e01c123e034","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642460400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642719600}","startTimestamp":1642460400,"endTimestamp":1642719600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST']","results":"[{'total': 261221.31, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

To read the full proposal, refer to 'Discussions to' above.*\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nThe Finance Nest consists of finance and risk experts with experience in TradFi asset management, Big4 financial service accounting and DAO treasury management. We are a group of people that have a strong track record which has demonstrated the required skill and qualities to be able to make key decisions on treasury management and finances at the Index Coop.\n\nAfter topping the IIP count last year, we are asking the community for more autonomy to act in the community\u2019s best interests, allowing for more streamlined execution which is essential to scaling and growing the DAO operations. We have identified challenges within the current construct we wish to overcome and we believe, as much as everyone loves a good IIP, the community would prefer a few less from Finance Nest.\n# Abstract\n\nFinance Nest seeks the approval of the community to extend the current guidelines\/boundaries enabling the ability to act with more autonomy. As the DAO moves closer towards creating nests with clearer roles and responsibilities, as outlined [here](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/index-2-0-leadership-governance-and-decision-making-pods-nest-and-wise-owls\/3214), Finance Nest requests delegation of decision making power to those with the most context on the subject matter. Finance nest has built trust, has an on-chain and governance forum track record of demonstrating the ability to execute with the community\u2019s interest front of mind. Finance Nest is leading the nest movement and provides several periodic reports providing insight into ongoing DAO financial operations.\n\nHowever, recently we have had three distinct issues whereby the IIP process has caused hesitation or prevented swift intervention to rectify the situation. These emerging situations create a risk for our community and Finance Nest wants to help by being empowered to act swiftly.\n\nThis proposal delegates the ability to Finance Nest to perform a number of day to day type operations in a more autonomous manner as well as providing some much needed crisis management functional support. With more autonomy, streamlined decision making and ability to act in crisis situations, the Finance Nest can serve the community better. The Finance Nest will continue to provide periodic updates on the governance forum, host the Money Talks discussion each week in Discord which will be structured in such a way as to give an update to the community along with fielding any questions that may arise as a result.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn recent times, there have been three clear incidents whereby the ability to act in the interest of the community was dampened by the existing construct.\n\n* Product launch seed liquidity (x2)\n* Product drifting from NAV (x1)\n\nIn each of the three instances mentioned above, hesitation and technicalities relating to the governance process caused significant delay and unwanted attention. Discussions focused around if the community\u2019s funds should be used to bridge the funding gap or used to arbitrage a product back to NAV before causing significant issues for various DeFi integrations. Index Coop has provided liquidity for two products to ensure smooth launches and with respect to arbitraging a product back to NAV, this was executed by individuals with their own capital.\n\nIn time the Liquidity Pod will have an approved budget, which is great. However, the lesson learned here is that the Finance Nest needs the ability to act with more autonomy without the risk of undermining the governance process.\n\nAs the community scales and grows, we need to implement an operating standard that ensures community funds are managed and deployed in a secure and efficient manner. This enables all members the ability to deploy or request that capital be deployed from the Operations Account into any protocol on the whitelist knowing sufficient due diligence has been performed. All deployments of community funds in size should be IIP approved and\/or fall within guidelines published on the governance forum.\n\nExamples of guidelines published to date:\n\n* [Stablecoin Asset Management Guideline](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/stablecoin-asset-management-guidelines\/2099)s\n* [TWG - Investment Account Philosophy](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/twg-investment-account-philosophy\/1564)\n* [Investment Account - Strategy Details](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/investment-account-strategy-details\/2792)\n\nCurrently, there is no approval list or standard approach to how\/where community funds can be deployed. Creating a whitelist with guidelines around how to be added to the whitelist solves for this. As we can see from the list of IIPs below, they are all in different formats and the information is scattered across the governance forum. The community will benefit from having a github directory displaying the whitelist of approved protocols.\n\n* [IIP-79: Authorize the Operations Account for Aave, Balancer, Compound, and Pool Together Strategies](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-79-authorize-the-operations-account-for-aave-balancer-compound-and-pooltogether-strategies\/2402)\n* [IIP-97: Authorize the Operations Account for Beta Finance & Rari Capital Strategies](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-97-authorize-the-operations-account-for-beta-finance-rari-capital-strategies\/2976)\n* [IIP-101: Authorize the Operations Account for Rari Capital Strategies](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-101-authorize-the-operations-account-for-rari-capital-strategies\/3076)\n* [IIP-109: Deploy Protocol-Owned INDEX\/ETH Liquidity into Managed Visor Vault on Uniswap v3](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/proposed-iip-109-deploy-protocol-owned-index-eth-liquidity-into-managed-visor-vault-on-uniswap-v3\/3238)\n* [IIP-115: Authorize the Investment Account for Aave, Compound, Balancer, Element Finance, Notional Strategies, Ribbon Finance and mStable](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-115-authorize-the-investment-account-for-aave-compound-balancer-element-finance-notional-strategies-ribbon-finance-and-mstable\/3279)\n\nThis whitelist provides a much needed layer of security ensuring Finance Nest and others alike only acts within the bounds defined by the community. This reduces the possibility of the community losing funds or transactions directing funds beyond the approved list being processed. If the protocol is not on the whitelist, then this gives signers the ability to question a transaction in an easy and effective manner.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Operation & Investment Accounts\n\nThis proposal enables Finance Nest the ability to create Operations and Investment Accounts with the same list of signers across all networks. This is needed to support the deployment of FLI products on various networks and enable Finance Nest to act quickly. The risk becomes that if [FLI products can launch without IIPs](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-xy-delegate-fli-launch-decisions-to-pwg-dfp-on-a-per-chain-basis\/3599\/3), then Finance Nest needs the ability to act at the same speed and with similar delegation of authority. Capital can be moved between various accounts at the discretion of the Finance Nest and will only be deployed into protocols on the community\u2019s protocol approved whitelist.\n\nDo note any changes to the signers will still run through the IIP process. We do not want a situation to occur where people can be added for the sole purpose of facilitating faster transactions. Rather we encourage the correct multisig structure and signer requirements to protect community funds.\n\nFinance Nest will be creating guidelines outlining best practices for creating various multisig Gnosis Safes across the DAO. This guideline will be the standard that that community discusses and then implements. Some of the things to be included are shown below:\n\n* Number of signers required depending on level of capital within the account\n* Signers per Nest - specifies number of signers from a specific nest\n* Capital holding levels\n* Interaction with the whitelist\n* How to appropriately document transactions\n\nThe initial guidelines for discussion will be published on the forum in the coming weeks\u2026\n\n## Crisis Management\n\nThis proposal enables Finance Nest the ability to use community funds within the Operations Account to support Index Coop products when crises emerge without the need to go through the IIP process. The Index Coop Council (ICC) will be kept informed in real time and events will be either reported via a standalone forum post or the next Operations Account publication. For significant events whereby we need to deviate from white lists or large amounts of capital will have to be deployed, an open discussion will be held with the ICC and Finance Nest advice given on the best course of action. In this type of scenario we will follow best practices like those displayed by Aave with respect to [AIP-44](https:\/\/app.aave.com\/#\/governance\/44-QmNVWrrm3ieyRRVD4f77zdxrvSUj1W4HDCojLKNcxmVQhr) and on the [governance forum](https:\/\/governance.aave.com\/t\/aip-44-discussion\/5965) as events unfolded.\n\nA recent example of this was when a product drifted 10% from Net Asset Value (NAV), the Operations Account could have been used to arbitrage the product back to NAV. Instead individuals performed arbitrage trades with their own capital. Please note, there is now an IC controlled\/affiliated bot now arbitraging the pool back to NAV. This is an example of an unanticipated need to act and by not having access to the Operations Account capital it caused delays, indecision and in the end alternative solutions had to be found. We seek to avoid being in this predicament if something like this ever happens again.\n\n## Approve & Request Funding from the Treasury Account\n\nThe Funding Council\u2019s responsibility to request quarterly funding has been passed to [Finance Nest through the INDEX 2.0 process.](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/index-2-0-our-future-of-finance\/2969) With the ICC being formed in recent months this group has been given the delegated authority on a number of matters, one being the ability to approve quarterly Nest budget funding requests, examples shown below. The Finance Nest, upon receiving an ICC approved budget, seeks the ability to request funds from the community Treasury without the need to go through the IIP process. Finance Nest seeks the autonomy to request quarterly funding without IIP.\n\nWe can see below the IIP\u2019s proposed for quarterly funding since genesis, all which have passed with no resistance.\n\n* [IIP-4 Create a Treasury Committe](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-4-create-a-treasury-committee\/190)e\n* [IIP-10 Treasury Committee Grant #2](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-10-treasury-committee-grant-2\/373)\n* [IIP-21 Treasury Committee Grant #3](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-21-treasury-committee-grant-3\/1067)\n* [IIP-59: Funding Council Grant #4](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-59-funding-council-grant-4\/2033)\n* [IIP-94: Funding Council Grant #5](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-94-funding-council-grant-5\/2944)\n* [IIP-85 Temporary Funding Council Decision Making](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-85-temporary-funding-council-decision-making\/2668)\n\nThis will allow the Index Coop to remain well funded without significant delay due to the governance process. This also means we can discretionary request smallers transfers more frequently rather than all at once. The key is to have enough INDEX & USDC to support short term operational needs and to operate within the ICC defined budget published quarterly on the governance forum. Finance Nest will still need to request USDC from the Treasury to the Investment Account ( non Operational needs ) in line with the current IIP process.\n\n## Manage Revenue\/Asset Mix\n\nAs the DAO grows we expect to see an increasing need to more actively manage our capital. This is especially the case for FLI product revenue streams, numerous other product revenue streams and our stablecoin reserves, as we are likely to reward more contributors with stables going forward.\n\nAs the Operations Account receives inflows of various assets and accommodates outflows in various assets, Finance Nest requests to formally recognise the ability to manage the composition of the Operations Account to suit operational needs. This includes the ability to swap assets to suit the cost base, reduce leverage exposure to match a desired risk profile, etc.. A prior IIP detailing approval to sell FLI periodically to ETH is shown below.\n\n* [IIP-87: Transfer FLI Products in Treasury to Operations Account](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-87-transfer-fli-products-in-treasury-to-operations-account\/2444)\n\nWe do note that all INDEX sales need to go through the IIP process. Something as sensitive as selling INDEX large amounts of INDEX ( \u226550,000 USD ) needs to and will continue to be approved via the IIP process. Currently, only day to day operations whereby INDEX is sold on a decentralized exchange to then make payments occurs. As the Operations Account offers Nest all kinds of tokens, we do not see a need for any Nest\/Pod to be swapping large amounts of INDEX for any other token.\n\nCommunity capital will always be managed in line with the respective published guidelines.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe Finance Nest gains the following autonomy and ability to act:\n\n* Create Operations and Investment Account Wallets with the current signer configurations\n* Enable the use of funds from the Operations Account during times of crisis\n* Autonomy to request funding from the Treasury Account\n* Manage revenue\/asset mix to meet capital needs within the Operations Account\n* Create and maintain a Whitelist of protocols for capital deployments \u2267 50,000 USD per protocol\n* Ability to manage assets within the Operations and Investment Account in line with published guidelines\n\n# Voting\n\nFOR:\n\nDO delegate more autonomy to Finance Nest and create a Whitelist as detailed above.\n\nAGAINST:\n\nDO NOT change the existing arrangement.\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/publicdomain\/zero\/1.0\/).","protocol":"indexCoop","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xc2971FE806CE4438dA09e21fC7be7FB121Cf7e13","totalVotes":44,"blockNumber":14023781,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/index-coop.eth\/proposal\/0x0105723cee50a08228d55516ce5ad1418795b21d5ac827086538154a8f8c5f64","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642442400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642701600}","startTimestamp":1642442400,"endTimestamp":1642701600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST']","results":"[{'total': 128236.48, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

We are a group of people that have a strong track record which has demonstrated the required skill and qualities to be able to make key decisions on treasury management and finances at the Index Coop.\n\nAfter topping the IIP count last year, we are asking the community for more autonomy to act in the community\u2019s best interests, allowing for more streamlined execution which is essential to scaling and growing the DAO operations. We have identified challenges within the current construct we wish to overcome and we believe, as much as everyone loves a good IIP, the community would prefer a few less from Finance Nest.\n# Abstract\n\nFinance Nest seeks the approval of the community to extend the current guidelines\/boundaries enabling the ability to act with more autonomy. As the DAO moves closer towards creating nests with clearer roles and responsibilities, as outlined [here](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/index-2-0-leadership-governance-and-decision-making-pods-nest-and-wise-owls\/3214), Finance Nest requests delegation of decision making power to those with the most context on the subject matter. Finance nest has built trust, has an on-chain and governance forum track record of demonstrating the ability to execute with the community\u2019s interest front of mind. Finance Nest is leading the nest movement and provides several periodic reports providing insight into ongoing DAO financial operations.\n\nHowever, recently we have had three distinct issues whereby the IIP process has caused hesitation or prevented swift intervention to rectify the situation. These emerging situations create a risk for our community and Finance Nest wants to help by being empowered to act swiftly.\n\nThis proposal delegates the ability to Finance Nest to perform a number of day to day type operations in a more autonomous manner as well as providing some much needed crisis management functional support. With more autonomy, streamlined decision making and ability to act in crisis situations, the Finance Nest can serve the community better. The Finance Nest will continue to provide periodic updates on the governance forum, host the Money Talks discussion each week in Discord which will be structured in such a way as to give an update to the community along with fielding any questions that may arise as a result.\n\n# Motivation\n\nIn recent times, there have been three clear incidents whereby the ability to act in the interest of the community was dampened by the existing construct.\n\n* Product launch seed liquidity (x2)\n* Product drifting from NAV (x1)\n\nIn each of the three instances mentioned above, hesitation and technicalities relating to the governance process caused significant delay and unwanted attention. Discussions focused around if the community\u2019s funds should be used to bridge the funding gap or used to arbitrage a product back to NAV before causing significant issues for various DeFi integrations. Index Coop has provided liquidity for two products to ensure smooth launches and with respect to arbitraging a product back to NAV, this was executed by individuals with their own capital.\n\nIn time the Liquidity Pod will have an approved budget, which is great. However, the lesson learned here is that the Finance Nest needs the ability to act with more autonomy without the risk of undermining the governance process.\n\nAs the community scales and grows, we need to implement an operating standard that ensures community funds are managed and deployed in a secure and efficient manner. This enables all members the ability to deploy or request that capital be deployed from the Operations Account into any protocol on the whitelist knowing sufficient due diligence has been performed. All deployments of community funds in size should be IIP approved and\/or fall within guidelines published on the governance forum.\n\nExamples of guidelines published to date:\n\n* [Stablecoin Asset Management Guideline](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/stablecoin-asset-management-guidelines\/2099)s\n* [TWG - Investment Account Philosophy](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/twg-investment-account-philosophy\/1564)\n* [Investment Account - Strategy Details](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/investment-account-strategy-details\/2792)\n\nCurrently, there is no approval list or standard approach to how\/where community funds can be deployed. Creating a whitelist with guidelines around how to be added to the whitelist solves for this. As we can see from the list of IIPs below, they are all in different formats and the information is scattered across the governance forum. The community will benefit from having a github directory displaying the whitelist of approved protocols.\n\n* [IIP-79: Authorize the Operations Account for Aave, Balancer, Compound, and Pool Together Strategies](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-79-authorize-the-operations-account-for-aave-balancer-compound-and-pooltogether-strategies\/2402)\n* [IIP-97: Authorize the Operations Account for Beta Finance & Rari Capital Strategies](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-97-authorize-the-operations-account-for-beta-finance-rari-capital-strategies\/2976)\n* [IIP-101: Authorize the Operations Account for Rari Capital Strategies](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-101-authorize-the-operations-account-for-rari-capital-strategies\/3076)\n* [IIP-109: Deploy Protocol-Owned INDEX\/ETH Liquidity into Managed Visor Vault on Uniswap v3](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/proposed-iip-109-deploy-protocol-owned-index-eth-liquidity-into-managed-visor-vault-on-uniswap-v3\/3238)\n* [IIP-115: Authorize the Investment Account for Aave, Compound, Balancer, Element Finance, Notional Strategies, Ribbon Finance and mStable](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-115-authorize-the-investment-account-for-aave-compound-balancer-element-finance-notional-strategies-ribbon-finance-and-mstable\/3279)\n\nThis whitelist provides a much needed layer of security ensuring Finance Nest and others alike only acts within the bounds defined by the community. This reduces the possibility of the community losing funds or transactions directing funds beyond the approved list being processed. If the protocol is not on the whitelist, then this gives signers the ability to question a transaction in an easy and effective manner.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Operation & Investment Accounts\n\nThis proposal enables Finance Nest the ability to create Operations and Investment Accounts with the same list of signers across all networks. This is needed to support the deployment of FLI products on various networks and enable Finance Nest to act quickly. The risk becomes that if [FLI products can launch without IIPs](https:\/\/gov.indexcoop.com\/t\/iip-xy-delegate-fli-launch-decisions-to-pwg-dfp-on-a-per-chain-basis\/3599\/3), then Finance Nest needs the ability to act at the same speed and with similar delegation of authority. Capital can be moved between various accounts at the discretion of the Finance Nest and will only be deployed into protocols on the community\u2019s protocol approved whitelist.\n\nDo note any changes to the signers will still run through the IIP process.

The Index Coop Council (ICC) will be kept informed in real time and events will be either reported via a standalone forum post or the next Operations Account publication. For significant events whereby we need to deviate from white lists or large amounts of capital will have to be deployed, an open discussion will be held with the ICC and Finance Nest advice given on the best course of action.

Execute fake deposits of 2**128-1 of DEFI5, CC10 and FFF to Polygon.\n      - These deposits will be received by a gnosis safe owned by the sigma committee and will be used to drain the assets in the DEFI5, CC10 and FFF market pairs on Polygon, which will be sent to the treasury.\n5. Upgrade the proxies for the core and sigma pools and controllers in order to remove the exploited vulnerability and disable the affected contracts.\n    - To prevent issues with staking rewards, DEFI5, CC10 and FFF will not be destroyed. An intermediate fallthrough proxy will be used for the pools that disables all functions except `balanceOf` on the affected pools and delegates to the fixed implementation for the unaffected pools.\n6. Destroy the CC10 UnboundTokenSeller.\n7. Set the core UnboundTokenSeller implementation back to what it currently is.\n8.

Approve the committee gnosis to spend 100,000 DAI from the treasury\n2. Approve the committee gnosis to spend 10,000 NDX from the treasury\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal outlines a framework for funding Indexed ecosystem development with grants from the Indexed Treasury. It is modeled on the [Uniswap Grants Program](https:\/\/sybil.org\/#\/proposals\/uniswap\/3), which was carefully crafted by several prominent investors and community figures in the DeFi space.\n\nThe scope of this program encompasses anything that helps the project\u2014sponsoring hackathons or gitcoin bounties, media sponsorships, community competitions\u2014anything is fair game. Eventually it could fund (with renewals approved by governance) core protocol development.\n\nGrant administration is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, thus we propose a nimble committee of 7 members\u20141 lead and 6 reviewers\u2014to deliver an efficient, predictable process to applicants, such that funding can be administered without having to put each application to a vote. A threshold of 4\/7 votes will be required to spend funds from the committee.\n\nWe propose the program start with a cap of 100,000 DAI + 10,000 NDX for the first quarter\u2014a sum that we believe is appropriate for an initial pilot\u2014renewable or adjustable after each epoch of six months.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe mission of the Indexed Growth Committee (IGC) is to identify and pursue opportunities which help to grow the Indexed ecosystem. These can be inbound requests or opportunities proactively pursued by the committee. The point is: to get more people involved in the growth of the project it is crucial to have a single point of contact responsible for filtering and reviewing the work proposals.\n\n## Budget & Renewals\n\n- Max budget of 100,000 DAI + 10,000 NDX for the first quarter.\n- Budget to be assessed after the first quarter and every six months thereafter.\n\nEach committee will have a term of 2 quarters (6 months\/one epoch), after which the program needs to be renewed by NDX governance, excepting the initial committee which will require renewal after the first quarter.\n\n## Initial Committee\n\nGnosis Safe: 0x45Ad0ef471ed7cDaD80B9D77fC43a2dF43E0d4C8\n\nLead: Lito Coen (0x79C4213a328E3B4F1D87b4953C14759399dB25E2)\n\nReviewers:\n1) Fabian Spiegelberger (0xED9c975cC9d4d5B482332bbB78207A59F2aac4F0)\n2) DBuck (0xB203df26AF3666f4214661f7f903C46EDF9403b0)\n3) Gregoire Le Jeune (0xE75E1BA066AcEC0428e6b631e1594F98e0D78268)\n4) Jeddi (0xc035C9F4272F8dBD3FEdd40C77C8B5D9B07c72f5)\n5) Jascha Samadi (0x20314e5D826B739CbcAC702c23a2Ab4c40Fb0940)\n6) Louis Guthman (0x283C8A919F63bAd7D9858ffDF16259C0740DFdAD)\n\n## Methodology\n\n### 1.1 Budget\nThis proposal recommends a max cap of US$100,000 + 10,000 NDX per quarter, with the ability to reevaluate after the first quarter and then biannually at each epoch (two fiscal quarters). While the IGC will be the decision makers around individual grants, respective budgets, roadmaps and milestones, any top-level changes to the IGC including epochs and budget will require a governance vote.\n\nThe IGC will be funded by the Indexed treasury via ERC20 allowances.\n\n### 1.2 Grant Application Process\nGrant applications to the IGC need to be submitted publicly in the forum. We will create a new \u201cGrant\u201d category for this purpose which is where all applications need to be submitted. Applications must be well-written and contain all the relevant information such as price, scope of the proposal, timeline, benefits etc. so that the committee and the community have all the information at hand.\n\nIn rare circumstances, if the committee reaches out proactively to a service provider and wants to keep it private for competitive reasons, it is acceptable to publish the proposal afterwards.\n\n### 1.3 Committee Compensation\nOperating a successful grants program takes considerable time and effort.\n\nThe lead should be compensated for their time. The reviewers will not be compensated for their time as we project that the commitment will be minimal to start (2-5hrs).\n\nWe propose the lead be compensated US$75\/hr capped at 10 hours\/week. This compensation will come from the the quarterly budget, which will be allocated to the IGC multisig from the NDX treasury. In keeping with the committee\u2019s commitment to the community, hours and duties will be logged publicly and transparently.\n\n### 2.1 Priorities\nInitially, the program aims to start narrow in scope, funding peripheral ecosystem initiatives, such as targeted bounties, education material, tooling & dashboards, media sponsorships, and other low-stakes means of building out the Indexed brand & ecosystem. Over time, if the program proves effective, the grant allocations can grow in scope to include, for example, listings on centralized exchanges, integrations into other dApps and eventually core protocol development.\n\n### 2.2 KPIS\nWith the initial priorities in mind, some effective measures for quick successes might look like:\n\n- Total number of initiatives funded\n- Quarterly increase in applications\n- Project engagement post-event\/funding (no of holders, TVL etc.)\n- Overall community engagement\/sentiment\n\n### 2.3 Timeline\nThe grants program will be managed on a quarterly basis and reviewed every two quarters after the pilot.\n\nAfter each quarter the committee will be required to submit a report on key metrics to the community.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis program is meant to be the simplest possible MVP of a Indexed Ecosystem Grants initiative. While the multi-sig committee comes with trust assumptions about the members, our hope is the community will approve this limited engagement to get the ball rolling in an efficient structure. After the first quarter the burden of proof will be on IGC to show empirical evidence that the program is worth continuing with renewed funding from the treasury.","protocol":"indexed","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x02bEf2CdEBb509D33d300896dc5c76B58Dbda95B","totalVotes":43,"blockNumber":12226615,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 12226615}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 12243895}","startTimestamp":1618249138,"endTimestamp":1618479879,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 465121.5, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 12243948}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1618480535}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 12258796}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1618678536}]"}

Having met this requirement - which allows the tokens to act as proxy ETFs - we believe that the next objective of the DAO should be the expansion of derivative utility for these instruments.\n\nSuch utility - even that as 'simple' as the ability to act as collateral - for these index trackers permits end-users and market makers alike increased flexibility in terms of managing their risk profile and ability to maximise returns via speculation on the near-term growth or decline of a market sector  through a single asset.\n\nDEFI5 is our flagship index at present, comprising assets that are already natural choices for lending collateral. Introducing the ability to lend against such an aggregate instrument - acting as it does as a volatility hedge for decentralised finance writ large - is, in our opinion, a natural step on the path to its wider adoption.\n\nAdoption of this proposal, and the subsequent introduction of DEFI5 to the Ruler protocol as a lendable asset, exposes our best performing product to a critical part of many DeFi strategies.\n\nWe encourage you to vote for this proposal, and look forward to working with Ruler.","protocol":"indexed","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xef764BAC8a438E7E498c2E5fcCf0f174c3E3F8dB","totalVotes":25,"blockNumber":12142984,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 12142984}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 12160264}","startTimestamp":1617138174,"endTimestamp":1617368909,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 1766955.2, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 12162646}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1617399954}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 12176099}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1617578340}]"}

However, now that this is done, we're faced with a dilemma:\n\na) We don't want to completely cut short incentivisation for liquidity providers - it's an effective way of buffering against impermanent loss, but...\nb) Handing out 25% of our maximum supply every three months is, in every sense of the word, unsustainable.\n\nWe're also in the unfortunate situation whereby the ORCL5 pool has *zero* incentivisation beyond it's USP of being the only aggregate instrument for exposure to that particular market sector, which - if we take TVL as the metric of choice - is not enough.\n\nMembers of the Sigma committee and the core team are currently working on a proposal for a longer term, dynamic reward emission schedule parameterised over TVL on a per-index basis, which we intend to `solve' this problem over a period of years rather than months. The first sighting of this idea in the wild is [here](https:\/\/forum.indexed.finance\/t\/future-emission-schedule-the-technical-side\/379), but it is not ready for consideration.\n\n---\n\nTo this end, I'm making the following proposal, in the hopes that we can fast-track it into action if it's agreeable.\n\n## Action Points\n\n* Allocate 100,000 NDX from the DAO treasury for a _one-month_ continued emission schedule, split as follows:\n  * [50,000 NDX] DEFI5-ETH Uniswap LP\n  * [40,000 NDX] CC10-ETH Uniswap LP\n  * [10,000 NDX] ORCL5-ETH Uniswap LP\n\n* Begin emissions for these new reward pools to minimise the amount of time that we're `off-road'.\n\n* End the `pure' DEFI5 and CC10 pools upon expiry. Their purpose (fast dissemination of NDX) has been served.\n\n* Deduct this 100,000 NDX from whatever amount we determine the longer-term final allocation to be (i.e. if we allocate 2.5 million NDX over a two year period, we'd initialise with 2.4 million instead).\n  * As a case in point, if those were the numbers we ended up using, we'd be handing out ~104,000 NDX per month anyway, so this is a stopgap in the truest sense of the word.\n\n## Transactions\n\n1. Create staking rewards pool for ORCL5-ETH Uniswap LP tokens, with 10,000 NDX over 30 days.\n2. Set the duration on the DEFI5-ETH staking pool to 30 days.\n3. Set the duration on the CC10-ETH staking pool to 30 days.\n4. Set the reward amount on the DEFI5-ETH staking pool to 50,000 NDX.\n5. Set the reward amount on the CC10-ETH staking pool to 40,000 NDX.","protocol":"indexed","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xef764BAC8a438E7E498c2E5fcCf0f174c3E3F8dB","totalVotes":86,"blockNumber":11997699,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 11997699}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 12014979}","startTimestamp":1615204526,"endTimestamp":1615434978,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 1924531.8, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 12015935}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1615447648}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 12029290}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1615626483}]"}

We already have a system in place for deploying proxies and handling upgrades, but it only allows the Indexed timelock to add new base implementations or approve new pool controllers. Since the purpose of the Sigma program is to speed up the pace of development, we should allow the Sigma committee to execute certain functions on the existing contracts, rather than complicate our architecture by setting up a myriad of new factories.\n\n# Access Control Changes\n\nThis proposal will transfer ownership of the pool factory and the proxy manager to separate access control contracts. These new contracts simply define a new administrator role, which is then granted access over specific functions. The Indexed timelock will still be the owner of these access control contracts and will have the sole authority to grant and revoke administrator access.\n\nBelow are the new privileges that will exist for the admin and owner roles. All admin privileges are shared by the owner.\n\n## Proxy Manager\n\n**Admin Privileges**\n- Deploy new one-to-one proxies\n- Deploy new many-to-one proxies\n- Add new many-to-one implementation contracts\n- Grant many-to-one deployment access to contracts\n\n**Owner Privileges**\n- Modify & lock one-to-one proxy implementations\n- Modify & lock many-to-one proxy implementations\n- Transfer ownership of the proxy manager\n- Revoke many-to-one deployment access from contracts\n- Grant admin role\n- Revoke admin role\n\n## Pool Factory\n\n**Admin Privileges**\n- Grant deployment access to contracts.\n\n**Owner Privileges**\n- Revoke deployment access from contracts.\n- Grant admin role\n- Revoke admin role\n- Transfer ownership of the pool factory\n\n## Deployments\n\nPool Factory Access Control \n<https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xb8fdBd8D10b394f85F777969564b6D49D6EbAAA2#code>\n\nProxy Manager Access Control \n<https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x3D4860d4b7952A3CAD3Accfada61463F15fc0D54#code>\n\nFor both of these, I deployed the access control contract, added the Sigma committee's multisig as an administrator, then transferred ownership to the Indexed timelock.","protocol":"indexed","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xef764BAC8a438E7E498c2E5fcCf0f174c3E3F8dB","totalVotes":40,"blockNumber":11897950,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 11897950}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 11915230}","startTimestamp":1613879333,"endTimestamp":1614108015,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 404595.66, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 11918955}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1614158139}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 11934492}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1614364396}]"}

This gives Indexed governance the ability to assess allocations and veto them if desired. The timelock also allows Indexed governance to replace the Sigma committee or reclaim the remaining tokens.\n\nCommittee Timelock Contract: https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x9BF4bE02414568eb481F448149432c6863737966\n\nCommittee Gnosis Safe: https:\/\/gnosis-safe.io\/app\/#\/safes\/0xBb22A47842EaFc967213269280509A8B28e57076\n\n## Code Review\nA code review was conducted by Daniel Luca and Andrei Simion over the course of 3 days to evaluate the overall access control system, the committee timelock and committee proxy contracts, and some minor changes to other proxy contracts which will be used for the next pool controller.\n\nThe review found one medium issue, three minor issues and one informational issue. The medium issue involved the voting period on GovernorAlpha and user expectations about when a proposal would finish; we'll resolve this by adding links to block countdowns on Etherscan to the governance proposal pages. The minor issues had to do with external event tracking & readability, and they were addressed with small contract updates. The informational issue was considered expected behavior and was not addressed.\n\nThe full code review can be found here: https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/monoceros-alpha\/review-indexed-sigmacommittee-2021-02\/master\/Report.pdf\n\n## Committee Members\n\nThe members of the committee are:\n\n| Forum Username | Appointed By | Address |\n|------|---------------|----------|\n| @d1ll0n | Team | 0x236ECcAB8cdcfEDb099dE85c4060024bA3cE4d46 |\n| @litocoen | Team | 0x330F1997C9bBC66bE5f1A3B0f2F6403051Ea57Be |\n| @Norsefire | Community | 0x000000000057E8ABd581828A2b40076852C0bA6E |\n| @Strategy | Community | 0x2c87C3ac0DE22076eca02dB7C66938fCAcB7035e |\n| @blurr | Community | 0xef764BAC8a438E7E498c2E5fcCf0f174c3E3F8dB |\n","protocol":"indexed","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x02bEf2CdEBb509D33d300896dc5c76B58Dbda95B","totalVotes":19,"blockNumber":11879654,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 11879654}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 11896934}","startTimestamp":1613635974,"endTimestamp":1613864851,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 58919.758, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2041519.2, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 11913036}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1614080026}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 11897011}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1613865764}]"}

Adding a 2-day voting delay will allow INST tokenholders to delegate and assign voting power after a proposal is submitted on-chain and will help increase voter participation. The Voting Period is currently set to slightly above 2.5 days, this will modify the voting period to 3 days.\n\n#### Adding Support for ERC-721 and ERC-1155:\nThis update will update the base implementation for both ERC-721 and ERC-1155 by adding functions ERC721Received(), ERC1155Received(), and ERC1155BatchReceived(). This will enable better handling and usage of these standards across all DeFi Smart Accounts.\nCode Change: https:\/\/github.com\/Instadapp\/dsa-contracts\/pull\/48\n\n#### Beta Mode:\nThis update adds Beta Mode to the base implementation. This will allow DSA owners to enable \u2018Beta Mode\u2019 which will grant that account access to upcoming and experimental features which are not enabled by default when creating an account.\nCode Change: https:\/\/github.com\/Instadapp\/dsa-contracts\/pull\/42\n\nMain PR with all the updates combine:- https:\/\/github.com\/Instadapp\/dsa-contracts\/pull\/50","protocol":"instadapp","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xA45f7bD6A5Ff45D31aaCE6bCD3d426D9328cea01","totalVotes":10,"blockNumber":13129210,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13129210}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13146490}","startTimestamp":1630357689,"endTimestamp":1630588858,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR', 'ABSTAIN']","results":"[{'total': 5770481.5, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13151512}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1630655608}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13165306}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1630839700}]"}

Ruler separates itself from other lending\/borrowing platforms by offering non-liquidatable loans while also not requiring a Chainlink oracle.\n\nI propose we incentivize the liquidity pools with 30 INV (~$40,000) from April 1st to April 30th. Ruler will match the 30 INV with 200 RULER (~$40,000), for a total of $80,000 in rewards over the month (4\/1-4\/30). The current March expiry INV pair has 200 RULER as incentives and has gathered ~$425k in liquidity. Doubling the rewards by adding INV should increase liquidity to close to $850k, enough to support large borrows.\n\nRationale\nThe value of the 80 airdropped INV is currently valued at ~$104,000. Even with a conservative mint ratio, large amounts of borrowing would drastically shift the interest rates if there is a lack of liquidity. \n\nAction\nIncentivize the Ruler INV pair from April 1st to April 30th by transferring 30 INV from the Inverse treasury to Ruler multisig (0x49B8a0893B83A171D7d461198b69A0b1bb4dd0Ed).\n\nOutcome\n30 INV + 200 RULER will be rewarded from April 1st to 30th ($80,000 in total rewards over a month).\n\nBy offering INV rewards to LPs, compounded with the use of crv.finance pools, the liquidity will be sufficiently deep enough to support large borrows\/lends.

[KeeperDAO Coordination Game Economics](https:\/\/docs.keeperdao.com\/reference\/developers\/coordination-game\/economics)\n5. [https:\/\/dune.xyz\/dani\/Liquity](https:\/\/dune.xyz\/dani\/Liquity)\n\n## Background\n\nThe B.Protocol B.AMM [2,3] is a novel automated market maker smart contract which allows backstop liquidity providers (\u201dBackstoppers\u201d) to earn fees during liquidations. Backstoppers provide liquidity (e.g. DAI), which normally sits idle and farms yield. When a loan becomes liquidatable, the protocol removes some idle funds (e.g. DAI) in order to purchase the distressed collateral (e.g. ETH), removing the risk from the lending protocol and restoring the health of the loan. \n\nThe system, which was balanced before, is now long ETH and short DAI, and needs to rebalance. The B.AMM facilitates rebalancing with a pricing curve derived from the Curve CFMM formula, which will offer traders on the B.AMM a discount that incentivizes them to arbitrage away the imbalance. Fees collected from swaps on the B.AMM go to the Backstoppers.\n\nFor a full report, see the B.Protocol B.AMM blog post [2] or B.AMM whitepaper [3].\n\n### KeeperDAO Coordination facility\n\nKeeperDAO and B.Protocol have worked together to research an improvement to the B.AMM which will increase the efficiency of small to medium-sized liquidations, adding value for both B.AMM LPs and the lending protocols which the B.AMM is used to backstop.\n\nThrough a modification of the B.AMM fees, KeeperDAO can extend the Coordination protocol to the B.AMM, creating a highly efficient environment that prevents MEV leakage and allows KeeperDAO keepers to perform rapid, continuous removal of small to medium-sized portfolio imbalances in the B.AMM. \n\nThe fee modification will allow KeeperDAO keepers to reach arbitrage price sooner, hiding MEV and allowing execution to take place through the Coordination protocol, where it can be fairly re-distributed. The improved rebalance efficiency that results will in turn improve yields for Backstoppers, since less of the collateral will be lost to the discount, ultimately helping the B.AMM in its goal of incentivizing a steady reserve of backstop liquidity. The vast majority (~80%) of the MEV captured by KeeperDAO will be redistributed back to the B.AMM through the Coordination Game Economic System [4]. This is Coordinomics in action \u2014 everybody wins.\n\n### KeeperDAO liquidity commitment\n\nFor every B.AMM that supports the Coordination protocol, KeeperDAO will commit seed liquidity to help the B.AMM reach immediate production readiness after deployment. This will allow integration partners to be assured of an adequate backstop and service level from the start, and have the added benefit of assuring our commitment to servicing the B.AMM.\n\nOnce a particular B.AMM is saturated with other LPs, KeeperDAO may withdraw the seed liquidity and make it available for a successive integration. Deposits in the B.AMM are yield-bearing, and are estimated to earn roughly 10% APY depending on the asset.\n\n### Transaction flow for KeeperDAO Keepers\n\nThe initial B.AMM to support the Coordination protocol is planned to be the B.AMM currently supporting Liquity\u2019s LUSD token.\n\nThe B.AMM currently handles approximately 25% of all LUSD liquidations. LUSD liquidation activity can be viewed using the Liquity Dune Analytics dashboard [5].\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Earmark $5,000,000 of stablecoins from the KeeperDAO Treasury for use as seed liquidity for new B.AMM deployments that support the Hiding Game.\n2. Stand ready to deposit this liquidity in successive target B.AMM contracts after security review, auditing, and deployment is complete, as long as other capital requirements have been met.\n3. Return this liquidity along with any yields accrued during its use, to the KeeperDAO Treasury on completion of the program, as determined by the relevant contributors.\n\n","protocol":"keeperdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x00fA720A0943Cc51145b78775d2A4B8B5d83EcCc","totalVotes":12,"blockNumber":14166578,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rook.eth\/proposal\/0x7c7ee0c3c4c6c81240ed474dd0e2c82dba32aa0bde7c5ff49d30796a353baddb","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644339600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644598800}","startTimestamp":1644339600,"endTimestamp":1644598800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Object', 'No objection']","results":"[{'total': 7143.225, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Utilizing these assets is preferred to leveraging our stablecoins as it reduces the amount of directional asset risk that the DAO assumes. \n\n### Potential Strategic Uses\n\n* Expand, retain, and incentivize contributors that are vital to the future development of new products and infrastructure for KD\n* Allow for additional strategic partnerships, M&A activity, or other strategic token swaps\n* Allow for future fundraising initiatives\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Expands the balance of ROOK that can be deployed through governance to potential support future growth\/retention in contributors and other strategic initiatives\n* Signals a level of confidence in the soundness and liquidity of the DAO\u2019s treasury\n* Reduces the amount of ROOK circulating in the open market\n* Raises awareness of the ROOK token\n\n### Risks\n\n* Increases the percentage of a native asset which at times is less liquid\n* Reduces near-term options to acquire other assets that may better diversify KD\u2019s portfolio or provide a higher rate of return.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPrior to the launch of the CG, a maximum of $4,000,000 of DAO Treasury ETH and\/or BTC may be used to acquire ROOK from the open market at the discretion of the treasury multisig signers, with the potential to delegate all or part of the execution to an individual from among the signers. The acquired ROOK will be deposited in the DAO Treasury.

Community members now constitute the vast majority (85%) of full-time contributors, up from 0% in June 2021.\n\nContributors have self-organized to tackle important tasks that in many other DAOs would be the responsibility of a \"Core Team\", including:\n\n- Designing and implementing a new KeeperDAO app.\n- Creating a new brand image and visual design.\n- Creating new websites, documentation, and marketing materials.\n- Establishing regular community calls and townhalls with featured guests\n- Launching the [KeeperDAO governance](https:\/\/blog.keeperdao.com\/introducing-keeperdao-governance\/) system.\n- Founding [KeeperDAO Labs](https:\/\/blog.keeperdao.com\/labs\/) and administering a grants program for new contributors.\n- Active development on Ninja, the Coordination Game, Hiding Book, and Hiding Vaults.\n- Conducting business development, partner, and DAO-to-DAO discussions.\n- Managing DAO treasury positions and yield-generating opportunities.\n\nThis is a great accomplishment for our community and founding team. This period of bootstrapping has shown us what a DAO can do, and we want to build on that in order to accelerate into the next phase of KeeperDAO's growth.\n\n### The next 3 months: setting up for expansion\n\nThis KIP is the catalyst for a broad transformation to take place over the next 3 months, from January-March 2022. During this time we will collectively incubate the new KeeperDAO, by making investments in talent, education, and organization, in order to emerge as a new DeFi powerhouse.\n\nRather than attempt to create a perfect structure in advance, wasting precious time and initiative, this proposal suggests to temporarily empower key players jz and hazard to begin the process of transformation, and accomplish the remaining major steps gradually during the next quarter, with the entire process overseen and shaped by Sophons and members of the community.\n\nThe appointments of jz and hazard were proposed (by unanimous consent) of the contributors from both the core and labs teams in [Proposing a KeeperDAO Leadership Team](https:\/\/keeperdao-labs.notion.site\/Proposing-our-Leadership-Team-e4de957ca0514f26a17dff372b65781e).\n\nThe draft organizational plan, i.e. what we are today aiming for as an end-state of the transformation, but which is subject to change, may be summarized as:\n\n1. A DAO charter or constitution\n2. An executive coordination team of CEO and CTO\n3. An oversight team of Sophons, aided by the DAO at large\n4. Transparent compensation and contributor guidelines\n5. Transparent budgeting and funding process\n6. Transparent objectives and performance review process\n7. A set of delegated powers\n8. A set of coordinating teams, each with:\n      - Mission\n      - Facilitator(s)\n      - Measurable objective(s)\n      - Budget\n\nMore details can be found in [The New Citadel: A Vision for KeeperDAO](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/The-New-Citadel-A-Vision-for-KeeperDAO-7c436bae5da141fba917e8a7ce6542a8).\n\n## Specification\n\n1. This proposal creates the office of CEO and CTO\n2. This proposal appoints @hazard as CEO and @j_z as CTO\n3. This proposal grants the CEO and CTO operational authority to:\n    1. Identify and engage key contributors.\n    2. Determine and distribute DAO Treasury funds needed for interim compensation (pending ratification of a complete budget).\n    3. Set priorities and encourage team formation in areas of strategic importance.\n    4. Facilitate business development and integrations\n4. This proposal grants Sophons operational authority to review and challenge any and all actions of the CEO and CTO\n5. This proposal requires the CEO and CTO to work with stakeholders to develop a unified organizational framework which will allow KeeperDAO to scale while maintaining community governance, participation, and ownership.\n\nIf adopted, authorities granted will be in effect for three (3) months until the end of Q1 2022, i.e. March 31 at midnight UTC, unless superceded or extended by a subsequent KIP.","protocol":"keeperdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x00fA720A0943Cc51145b78775d2A4B8B5d83EcCc","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13948366,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rook.eth\/proposal\/0x9a755ea43fac59425fd37679d91e7fe2f7f09f3cd5e361a52c096f2054730494","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641402000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1641661200}","startTimestamp":1641402000,"endTimestamp":1641661200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Object', 'No objection']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

This proposal is contingent on Bancor approving an their matching governance proposal to increase in the co-investment limit from 1.3M BNT to 2.1M BNT and approve LM rewards for the ROOK-BNT pool.\n\n## Background\nBancor, a long standing integration partner and home for staking ROOK, has offered to increase their co-investment in the ROOK-BNT pool on their platform. Currently, they have already invested 1.3M BNT into the pool, and are offering to add additional BNT to bring the total to 2.1M BNT. Bancor is leaving additional room in the pool for other ROOK holders to join the pool.\n\nThere is currently **~1.3M BNT** and **~22K ROOK** tokens in the BNT-ROOK [pool](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xFa7b9AD60304119f59B172Ef78B98D50cb9A5c98).

It provides an infrastructure for protocols to use their own treasury funds to provide liquidity and generate yield. By providing liquidity on Uniswap v3 via Visor Finance, there will be deeper liquidity for the ROOK-ETH pair and an opportunity to generate higher yield on KeeperDAO\u2019s protocol controlled assets.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe capital efficiency of Uniswap v3 offers many advantages.  Given that much of the liquidity will be concentrated around the current price tick, there will be less slippage for same volume trades on the same amount of liquidity as on Sushiswap (or Uniswap v2).  For example, concentrating liquidity around +\/-50% of the current price may have up to 4x the capital efficiency of Sushiswap and may require less than 25% of the liquidity as Sushiswap. Additionally, the lower liquidity threshold required on Uniswap v3 allows for KeeperDAO to provide the liquidity with its own treasury and diminishes the need to pay liquidity mining rewards for ROOK-ETH.\n\nManaging the price range on Uniswap v3 requires active management, which is provided by Visor Finance and its research organization Gamma Strategies.  As the price of ROOK varies, Visor Finance will ensure that the price stays within range and that there is sufficient liquidity to support ROOK-ETH trade volume.\n\nThe current liquidity for ROOK-ETH is segregated among various AMMs which is inefficiently routing trades when using a DEX aggregator like 1inch or paraswap. The current liquidity situation is as follows:\n\n* Bancor: BNT \/ ROOK liquidity of $11M\n* Sushi: ETH \/ ROOK liquidity of $4.4M\n* Uni v2: ETH \/ ROOK liquidity of $4.8M\n* Uni v3: ETH \/ ROOK liquidity of $1.0M\n\nCurrently, a 10 ETH trade for ROOK is being routed partially to Bancor, Sushi, and\/or Uni v2 when using a DEX aggregator like 1inch because 1inch is routing trades in a way that gets the most favorable price impact based on slippage. The current slippage for a 10 ETH trade on each of the AMMs are as follows:\n\n* Bancor: 1.2%\n* Sushi: 2.1%\n* Uni v2: 1.4%\n* Uni v3: 0.8 - 3% (can vary depending on price action & placement of other liquidity)\n\nTherefore, in order to provide liquidity on Uni v3 to maximize profitability for KeeperDAO, the slippage should be lowered to 1.2% or below for a 10 ETH purchase.\n\nAccording to our analysis here: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1eCyNRl1jmk5f6Ndqk2V_BSVyCCO3hCTzUhgFYgy8K5Y\/edit#gid=0, we believe $3M of total liquidity, placed in at least a +\/- 40% range would be ideal for absorbing most of the trade volume from ETH to ROOK on Uni v3. Given the existing liquidity of $1M already in the Uni v3 pool, at least $2M should be provided by the KeeperDAO treasury to increase the likelihood of trades being routed to v3 and capturing the most volume & profitability.\n\n## Risks\n*Other liquidity:*  Currently, the majority (or over 80% of the liquidity) is currently being provided by a single address:  0xD6Cb7a7b544E24e5160A948a16C45b1096276F9d.  This could potentially leave KeeperDAO in a vulnerable position if all of that liquidity were to be removed by that single provider, and trades were continuously being routed through other venues.\n\n*Impermanent loss:*  Providing liquidity in a narrower price range can lead to earning higher fees, but can subject the liquidity provider to greater impermanent loss as prices of the underlying assets diverge.  Conversely, providing liquidity in a wider range will earn less fees than a narrower one, but are accordingly at lower risk of  suffering impermanent losses when there is price divergence.  \n\nGamma Strategies aims to reduce the risks of impermanent loss by widening the ranges during periods of high volatility and narrowing the ranges in periods of low volatility in order to maximize yields.\n\n## Process\nKeeperDAO will supply $1,000,000 USD of ROOK and $1,000,000 USD of ETH to the Visor position manager contract called the Hypervisor (https:\/\/github.com\/VisorFinance\/hypervisor\/blob\/master\/contracts\/Hypervisor.sol) , which will mint fungible ERC-20 LP tokens to a whitelisted address provided by KeeperDAO. \nOnly the whitelisted address provided by KeeperDAO will have the right to deposit \/ withdraw assets to and from the Hypervisor.  The position manager contract has the right to a few functions which are to set base ranges, set limit ranges, collect fees, rebalance, and mint\/burn LP tokens to the whitelisted address.  Therefore, the Hypervisor contract has only management rights and is non-custodial in that only the provided whitelisted address may deposit \/ withdraw assets into and out of the contract.\n\nVisor Finance takes 10% of earned fees, which get distributed to VISR stakers.  90% of earned fees will be automatically re-invested into the LP position upon each rebalance.  Visor Finance will cover all gas fees for rebalancing positions and re-investing earned fees. \n\n\n## Specification\n1. Send $1,000,000 USD of ROOK and $1,000,000 USD of ETH to the ROOK-ETH Hypervisor to be managed on the ROOK-ETH pool on Uniswap v3\n2.

For those unfamiliar, KeeperDAO emissions are generally set to decrease every Act by ~30%. At this current time, with KIP-2 having passed, we are already emitting 30% less than planned.\n\nAccordingly, I believe we should emit the same amount of ROOK as we do today (and was anticipated for Act V, before KIP-2). This is 404.25 ROOK per day. This is 38808 ROOK for the whole epoch (~96 days, depending on block speed).\n\n### KIP-2 Context\nThe key tenants of KIP-2, from @whatsthedeetz, were:\n\n* Hiding Vaults already receive significant benefits from Compound (interest and COMP distribution) and JITU (liquidity buffer). The ROOK rewards should be some (light) icing on the cake. \n\n* Hiding Vault rewards are not currently motivating users to take positions that create MEV. Until we are able to dynamically distribute rewards to different assets in an effort to dissuade same token supply and borrowing, the Hiding Vault will not be utilized to its full potential. \n\n### KIP-4 Context\nWith the passing of KIP-4, we also turn Hiding Game emissions into buy pressure with the beneath flywheel:\n\nEmission Value -> Volume -> Revenue -> Buy back -> Higher ROOK price -> Higher Emission Value\n\n### Buy Back (Continuation)\n\nWe would continue with buy backs until the release of the Coordination Game, as outlined in KIP-4.\n\nOverall, we will see about 30% more emissions (than today) go towards the Hiding Game, which we know correlates to volume.\n\n### Allocation\nAccordingly, I propose the following be default emissions for Act V:\n\n|Name|Percentage|# ROOK |# ROOK per day|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Hiding Game|70|27165.6|282.975|\n|Liquidity Pools|20|7761.6|80.85|\n|Hiding Vault|10|3880.8|40.425|\n|Total|100|38808|404.25|\n\nI propose these emissions be minted in 102528 block (~16 day) increments. This means every 102528 blocks, 6468 ROOK would be minted as outlined above. This will change with the release of the Coordination Game.\n\n### Key Blocks\n\n- **Act IV ends:** [Block 13617668](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/block\/countdown\/13617668)\n- **Second mint:** [Block 13720196](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/block\/countdown\/13720196)\n- **Third mint:** [Block 13822724](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/block\/countdown\/13822724)\n- **Fourth mint:**  [Block 13925252](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/block\/countdown\/13925252)\n- **Fifth mint:** [Block 14027780](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/block\/countdown\/14027780)\n- **Sixth (final) mint:** [Block 14130308](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/block\/countdown\/14130308)\n- **Act V ends:** [Block 14232836](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/block\/countdown\/14232836)\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1. For the duration of Act V, every 102528 blocks we will emit 6468 ROOK for users of the protocol (consistent with planned emission rate before KIP-2).\n2. This ROOK will be distributed with a ratio of 70% to the Hiding Game, 20% to Liquidity Pools, and 10% to Hiding Vault borrowers.\n3.

The overall cadence of the governance process is slowed by a 7 day open no objection voting period, while it seems nearly all participation occurs within the first 48 to 72 hours. If our goal is to be frictionless with agreement, and slower-moving with more opaque consensus, we should lower the minimum objection period for a vote to 72 hours, while letting Sophons choose to use the customary week for more hotly contested subjects.\n\n## Specification\n\n1.

This has been exacerbated by a lack of token liquidity.\n\n[Olympus Pro](https:\/\/docs.olympusdao.finance\/pro\/) offers an appealing resolution to this illiquidity.\n\n---\n\n## Analysis\n\nOlympus Pro bonds offer governance tokens at a discount in exchange for liquidity. Implementing ROOK bonds would provide a sustained source of protocol-owned liquidity for the treasury (ROOK:wETH Uniswap v2 tokens and Sushiswap).\n\nUltimately, owning productive liquidity with the treasury is a scalable, multi-beneficial adjustment.\n\n### Benefits\n\n\u2022 Permanent liquidity floor supports investors and minimizes down side risk\n\u2022 Token liquidity is an important factor many Price Oracles require\n\u2022 Minimizes Volatility\n\u2022 APY from trading fees\n\u2022 Additional DEX liquidity without having to commit treasury ETH reserves\n\n### Downsides & Risks\n\n\u2022 Discounted ROOK tokens open some surface area for arbitrage. The thesis is the bond period, with anticipated appreciation, would make it non-trivial to execute on the arbitrage. Bond vesting periods are configurable; the default is 7 days.\n\n### Why do this instead of putting up LP ourselves\n\n\u2022 Opportunity to distribute ROOK to a wider group of committed users\n\u2022 Discounted price for new ROOK buyers\n\u2022 Bond period briefly locks up ROOK\n\u2022 Relationship with a project with a strong community and potential for future synergies\n\n### Strategic Choice\n\n\u2022 We should not add additional emission sources by minting new ROOK tokens to commit to a bond program.\n\nInstead, we have a few choices. The most appealing option is to use Strategic Reserves ROOK. The founding team agrees this is an apt use for Strategic Reserves and would be happy to use 5,000 ROOK for this.\n\n### Olympus Pro Resources\n\n- [Olympus Pro Docs](https:\/\/docs.olympusdao.finance\/pro\/)\n- [Olympus Pro Announcement](https:\/\/olympusdao.medium.com\/introducing-olympus-pro-d8db3052fca5)\n- [Olympus Pro Site](https:\/\/www.olympusdao.finance\/pro)\n- [Olympus Pro Marketplace](https:\/\/pro.olympusdao.finance\/)\n\n---\n\n## Specification\n\n1.

Please read the full proposal using the GitHub link above.*\n\n## Proposal \n\nThe proposal is for KeeperDAO to invest 3,500,000 USDC in the liquidity pool where Maven 11 is a Pool Delegate. This amount of USDC would represent 3.1% of the value of KeeperDAO treasury\u2019s assets, or ~12% of the total stablecoin assets in KeeperDAOs treasury. Providing this amount of USDC to the liquidity pool would maintain risk at an appropriate level with negligible risk for the overall financial health of the DAO.\n\nThe main purpose of utilizing a portion of stablecoins held by the KeeperDAO treasury to provide liquidity on Maple Finance is to **generate an additional yield on now-idle assets** . This will enhance the capital efficiency of the treasury, the value of which will ultimately find its way back to the members of the DAO.\n\n\n**_Rewards_**\n\nLenders receive 80% of the interest payments from the borrowers in USDC, while the remaining 20% is distributed in a 50:50 split to the Maple Finance treasury and the PD. On top of that, Maple Finance provides incentives to the lenders in their native governance token MPL which can be used for staking (i.e. providing capital of last resort in case of defaults) and for governance of the protocol and the treasury.\n\n**To summarize** , depositing USDC in the Maven 11 liquidity pool on Maple Finance will generate two different flavors of yield: yield in USDC, and yield in the MPL governance token.\n\n- USDC yield, which currently hovers around 10% APY. This yield is subject to a 90 day lock up.\n- MPL reward token yield, which currently hovers around 25% APY. These reward tokens are released on a block by block basis.\n\nThis means that at time of writing, the total APY on USDC deposits is **roughly 35%** .\n\n**_The APY itself is dependent on 3 factors:_**\n\n1. **Interest rates** - when the interest rates among the borrowers in the pool are increasing, the USDC part of yield is increasing as well (and vice versa).\n2. **Amount of liquidity in the pool** - when the pool increases in size, the rewards in MPL are decreasing proportionally as the number of MPL tokens needs to be distributed among a larger number of participants (and vice versa).\n3. **MPL price** - when the price of MPL is increasing, the rewards in MPL are higher in $ terms, effectively increasing the APY (and vice versa).\n\n\n## Risks\n\nFor a full risk statement, please see the full proposal text on GitHub: https:\/\/github.com\/keeperdao\/kips\/blob\/master\/KIP-6\/KIP-6.md\n\n## Additional links\n\n[KeeperDAO treasury address](https:\/\/gnosis-safe.io\/app\/#\/safes\/0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4\/balances)\n\n[Maple Finance app ](https:\/\/app.maple.finance\/#\/liquidity)\n\n[Guide to lending on Maple ](https:\/\/maplefinance.ghost.io\/lending\/)\n\n[Maple Finance Dune Dashboard](https:\/\/dune.xyz\/scottincrypto\/Maple-Deposits)\n\n[Maple Finance AML KYC procedure ](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1ShpjSeYxEkUq63qIaR1Nmq8zT-BnWIWb\/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Master Loan Agreement (MLA) ](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1yy0E9LwS4y4bpyJ9syM7oMgA01cJKNrB-x0PI5Pw_Tg\/)\n\n[Maple Finance API docs](https:\/\/maplefinance.gitbook.io\/maple\/api\/public)\n\n[Credit Memo ](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1LL2z9gIFpq4hT-PblyF_s4-GXGO_4tUVAc3oViE1rJE\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Specification\n\n**1.** On Maple Finance, approve USDC to spend\n**2.** Deposit 3,500,000 USDC to the Maven 11 liquidity pool and receive Maple Pool Tokens (MPT), to be eligible for receiving USDC rewards\n**3.** Approve MPT to spend\n**4.** Stake MPT in Maple Finance, to be eligible for receiving MPL governance token rewards\n\n\n\n","protocol":"keeperdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x00fA720A0943Cc51145b78775d2A4B8B5d83EcCc","totalVotes":50,"blockNumber":13525510,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rook.eth\/proposal\/0x3f1c55b4749376cc123754bd0adc7fc78bc2d35bcb45c52ef4937c74ec8e2c9b","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1635710400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1636318800}","startTimestamp":1635710400,"endTimestamp":1636318800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['No objection', 'Object']","results":"[{'total': 31289.361, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1257.142, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Their upcoming offerings related to Curve v2 (stable\/BTC\/ETH or ETH v2 Pools) offer a very enticing opportunity for ROOK to gain substantial liquidity, as these could form the basis of composite pools (e.g. ROOK\/Tricrypto) in the same manner that the 3pool (USDC\/USDT\/DAI) forms the basis of composite pools with other stables (e.g. 3pool\/MIM).\n\nOwning a substantial portion of voting weight within the protocol can not only drive profitable emissions to KeeperDAO but also allow us to earn additional revenue through bribes from other protocols seeking influence over the Curve protocol.\n\nConvex offers an optimization that would allow KeeperDAO to aggressively gain more significant influence over the Curve protocol. This is because each vote-locked CVX token currently controls more than 7 vote-locked CRV tokens.\n\nKeeperDAO has grown its treasury to over $100 million (non-ROOK NAV) - this would be a novel and profitable way to exercise its power.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Yield\n\n- Bribe yield (acceptance of bribes)\n- Inflationary yield (of CVX and CVXCRV)\n- High yield (With bribes ~44%)\n- Distribute bribes into the treasury\n\n### ROOK pool\n\n1. Create a Curve v2 Pool\n2. Vote to ensure the pool has a significant gauge that is eligible for CRV rewards using our CRV voting power\n3. Ensure an appropriate level of CRV emissions are directed to this gauge through voting power\n4. Now people want to LP ROOK in the well-incentivized pool\n\n### Inter-DAO coordination\n\n- Using our voting power to help fellow DAOs to unlock shared value\n\n## Implementation\n\nA maximum of $40,000,000 from the DAO treasury will be used to acquire a CVX position, using a combination of USDC, DAI, ETH, and wETH, with a target minimum of 1,000,000 and a target maximum of 2,000,000 CVX, or a maximum average price of $40 per CVX.\n\nThe precise execution strategy is left opaque to minimize the risk of market speculation, front-running, et cetera. Upon completion, an update will be announced on Discord and Twitter with the full transaction details.\n\nWhen roughly $25 million of CVX has been acquired, this will be communicated with the DAO and we will collectively decide if we would like to proceed. The same action will be taken, if and once the next benchmark of ~$32.5 million of CVX has been acquired.\n\n### Asset Usage\n\nThe acquired CVX will be vote locked with Convex Finance for vlCVX. vlCVX will yield CVXCRV. This CVXCRV will be swapped for more CVX, which will be locked for vlCVX.\n\nThis initial strategy is subject to change at the discretion of the KeeperDAO core team with community involvement.\n\nThis position comes with no predetermined time horizon, but there is a 16-week lockup upon vote locking.\n\nManagement of the position, including voting and token decisions, will be at the collaborative discretion of the KeeperDAO core team and the community, with execution being performed by the core team. This allows for agile response and risk management while leaving open the option for the future structure.\n\nBy default, bribe yield will be deposited to the KeeperDAO treasury but may be put to use if an applicable staking mechanism applies. Collaborative discretion of the KeeperDAO core team and the community can amend this.\n\n## Risks\n\n- This involves substantial use of DAO treasury funds, gaining exposure to a volatile and risky asset.\n- Convex and Curve smart contracts have been audited, but still carry smart contract risk (see below).\n- CVX price could move outside of our parameters before the acquisition is completed. In addition, this position incurs opportunity costs that may limit other potential uses of those funds or alternative strategies.\n\n### Security reviews\n\n- [Convex Review by Defisafety ](https:\/\/docs.defisafety.com\/finished-reviews\/convex-finance-process-quality-review), July 2021\n- [Curve Review by Defisafety](https:\/\/docs.defisafety.com\/v\/0.6\/finished-reviews\/curve-finance-process-quality-audit), October 2020\n\n## Appendix\n\n[Notion Appendix ](https:\/\/keeperdao-labs.notion.site\/Convex-Acquisition-Appendix-a9b5149cbb3b4cf297d25b0ea5958e2f)\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Purchase between 1 and 2 million CVX before the end of 2021\n2. Establish a system to accept bribes for CVX vote\n3. Establish Curve v2 Pool\n4.

Ad hoc Individual Contributors were paid on completion of a given project. This budget proposal takes similar form, with intent to continue this work, while also adding three new IC roles (with flexibility for a fourth).\n\nRecent and current allocations can be found at 0xbBB8c9Ace4590d98f0A56FA311C6fBA0CEA3a68D, which has a budget lifespan that will last until October 4. With the ribbon-cutting of governance, it is time for budgets to be collectively assessed and ICs to be paid from a multi-sig.\n\n## Definitions\n**Ad Hoc** expenses are expenses which are paid on a case by case basis. These will be documented and published quarterly.\n\n**ICs (Individual Contributors)** are individuals who contribute to the development of the DAO in a formal sense.\n\n**Recurring** expenses are expenses which are paid on a cyclical schedule\n\n## Requested budget breakdown \n\n| Purpose | ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Engineering | 400 |\n| Partner Outreach Development | 120 |\n| Translations | 50 |\n| Discord Bot Development | 45 |\n| Community Grants | 250 |\n| **Total** | **865** |\n\n### Engineering budget\nWe will continue our two IC Engineers who are paid weekly at 10 ROOK\/week: @shadow and @pangolin. Their KeeperDAO work can be noticed with performance and design improvements throughout app.keeperdao.com. \n\nI also introduce a new role which we will be recruiting for: *Partner Integrations Engineer*. This role will be focused on assisting our partners with integration.\n\nAdditional discretionary funds for another IC role is included in case it is needed. If unused, it will roll over to the Quarter 1 2022 Budget.\n\nThese are *recurring* roles.\n\nAt a rate of 10 ROOK\/week for all of the above, the sum is 400 ROOK.\n\n| IC | Duration (weeks) | ROOK\n|---|---|---|\n| @pangolin | 13 | 130\n| @shadow | 4 | 40\n| Partner Integrations (TBD) | 11 | 110\n| Discretionary (TBD) | 11 | 110\n| **Total** | **39** | **400**\n\n### Partner outreach development\nWe are seeking someone to support connecting and facilitating relationships with potential partners. I believe @destroyr is a perfect candidate for both, and should be contracted as a `Partner Outreach Developer`. Troy has been involved in the space for several years, going back to helping Nano grow in 2017 and has also been intimately involved in KeeperDAO helping with documentation, web copy, and research.\n\nThis is a *recurring* role.\n\nAt a rate of 8 ROOK\/week for all of the above, the sum is 120 ROOK.\n| IC | Duration (weeks) | ROOK\n|---|---|---|\n| @destroyr  | 15 | 120\n| **Total** | **15** | **120**\n\n### Translations\nWe need translations for our many webpages and documents. We recently added German but we have some loose ends, and we should add support for Spanish. This is to fund that.\n\nThese are *ad hoc* roles.\n\n| Group | Ad Hoc ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Translators | 50 |\n| **Total** | **50**\n\n### Discord bot development\nThere are several bots for Discord we would like to add which are relevant to current products as well as future products. This is an open role, and can be filled by multiple bot developers (dividing and conquering is fine for this project).\n\nThis an *ad hoc* role.\n\n| Group | Ad Hoc ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Discord Bot Development | 45 |\n| **Total** | **45**\n\n### Community grants\nWith the birth of decentralized KeeperDAO Governance, I anticipate many small projects to come up to foster community growth, accelerate development, discover and support partners, and so forth.\n\nThe projects decided will largely be community-decided, community-driven, and community-developed. This will be completed transparently and also documented and compiled for a reviewable budget summary at the end of Quarter 4.\n\n| Group | Ad Hoc ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Community | 250 |\n| **Total** | **250**\n\n## Special considerations\n\n### Excess ROOK Rollover\nIf excess ROOK exists (due to an IC role not being filled, an ad hoc need becoming unneeded, an IC needing a week off, etc.), excess ROOK will carry over to the next quarter.\n\n### Retroactive payment\n\nThis KIP was targeting a September approval; the structure or intentions do not change. Due to the delay, some contributors are working on good faith so some of these above payments will be paid retroactively. That is all.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Before October 4, send 865 ROOK (and 1 Eth for gas) to a new multi-sig address. It will be managed like the IC address has been for the prior few months, with payments on Mondays for recurring ICs or on project completion by ad hoc ICs. The address will be managed by ~3 Core\/Labs members (including myself). I volunteer @WhatsTheDeetz and @Pai-Sho (if they have the bandwidth).

Mint 1299.375 ROOK\n 2. Transfer the minted ROOK to the Hiding Vault distributor contract [0xae7b93a591c37ea37ed8bc7b6b999c85f2ed2405](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xae7b93a591c37ea37ed8bc7b6b999c85f2ed2405).\n 3. Reduce the per-block reward factor for Hiding Vaults by 75%.\n\n## Background\n\nNow that the Hiding Vault has been established as an enhanced lending protocol, both in total value locked (TVL) and total amount borrowed, I proposing that we reduce the amount of ROOK that is emitted to users of the Hiding Vault.\n\n* Hiding Vaults already receive significant benefits from Compound (interest and COMP distribution) and JITU (liquidity buffer). The ROOK rewards should be some (light) icing on the cake. \n\n* Hiding Vault rewards are not currently motivating users to take positions that create MEV. Until we are able to dynamically distribute rewards to different assets in an effort to dissuade same token supply and borrowing, the Hiding Vault will not be utilized to its full potential. \n\nFor reference, here is the current remaining emissions for the last quarter of Act IV: \n\n|Name|Percentage|# ROOK this Act|# ROOK per day|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Hiding Vault|40|5197.5|231| \n|Hiding Game|40|5197.5|231|\n|Liquidity Pools|20|2598.75|115.5| \n|Total|100|12993.75|577.5|\n\nNote: Hiding Game and LP emissions have been fully minted for Act IV and cannot be adjusted until the beginning of Act V.\n\nAssuming that this could go live right as the third quarter of Act IV's emissions for Hiding Vault that were minted run out, the final proposed ROOK rewards for Act IV's final quarter would be: \n\n|Name|Percentage|# ROOK Remaining |# ROOK per day|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Hiding Game|40|5197.5|231|\n|Hiding Vault|10|1299.375|57.75|\n|Liquidity Pools|20|2598.75|115.5|\n|Not Minted|30|3898.125|0|\n|Total|100|12993.75|462|\n\n\n\n","protocol":"keeperdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x00fA720A0943Cc51145b78775d2A4B8B5d83EcCc","totalVotes":39,"blockNumber":13428875,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rook.eth\/proposal\/QmPejeYnjUZHAdzvgdUZLGjdc98kHbkp846LXJnT6epT2G","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1634400000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1634745600}","startTimestamp":1634400000,"endTimestamp":1634745600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['No objection', 'Object']","results":"[{'total': 39763.31, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Finally, it defines governance helpers called Sophons that coordinate the governance process.\n\n### Proposal\nAdopt the specified guidelines below, defining the KeeperDAO governance.\n\n## KeeperDAO improvement proposals\n\n### What is a KIP?\nA KIP is a proposal that an author or group of authors would like to be evaluated by the members of KeeperDAO. The members of KeeperDAO shall work with the author of a KIP to review and refine its content, before using an agreed-upon consensus procedure to collectively determine whether to adopt or decline the final proposal. \n\n### Minimum style requirements\nA KIP should be written in plain language, formatted as [Markdown](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Markdown). It should clearly and completely describe the proposal, its motivations, and why the author believes it improves the status quo. Where applicable, it should also describe a set of steps to enact the proposal. Authors and editors should work together to ensure that the KIP meets at least the following minimum style requirements:\n\n- **Consistency**: Does it contradict itself or any other non-historical KIP?\n- **Accuracy**: Are its data, arguments, and understanding of systems complete, accurate, and up-to-date?\n- **Feasibility**: Does it propose or require things that are impossible ot impractical to accomplish?\n- **Verifiability**: Can anyone verify for themselves that an implemention did occur in the way described by the KIP?\n\n\n### Recordkeeping\nKIPs form an archival series, meaning that each KIP has a unique archival serial number, and is not able to have its essential content changed once it has become finalized. At the top of every KIP is a header which contains metadata that editors can use to help organize the governance record. \n\n\n\nThese fields and their values may be changed in the governance repository without the need for a new consensus, as long as the change is recorded in the repository and carried out by those delegated to do so.\n\n## Governance lifecycle\n\n1. Author posts KIP draft on forum \n    1. When a new KIP appears on the forum, a notification and summary shall be posted to a relevant channel.\n\n2. Crowd Consensus\n    1. The author shall allow sufficient time for, and make a best effort to reach, rough consensus with the community about the content of the draft proposal. \n    2. When the author determines that rough consensus has been reached, the author shall communicate their intention to submit the proposal to the governance record for review.\n    3. The author shall make a best effort to allow sufficient time for all interested parties to post final comments on the draft before formal submission.\n    \n3. Merge to Git repository\n    1. The author shall open a pull request to the governance repository, aided by a Sophon if necessary.\n    2. A Sophon shall add the header fields to the KIP, and mark its status as `draft`, before merging it.\n\n4. Sophon Consensus\n    1. Sophons shall maintain a public queue of the merged KIPs to be reviewed. This queue shall be ordered chronologically according to the date of the git merge.\n    2. Sophons must make a best effort to review each KIP in order, and acheive rough consensus.\n    3. When a KIP enters review, a Sophon shall change the KIP status from `draft` to `review`.\n       1. During review, Sophons shall make a best effort to conduct their deliberations in public and record minutes, as well as be available for public feedback.\n       2. If Sophons cannot reach rough consensus, the proposal will return to `draft` status.\n       3. Otherwise, the Sophons will assign the KIP a voting period and change its status from `review` to `last-call`.\n\n5. Last call period\n    1. Sophons and the KIP author shall make efforts to notify interested parties, allow sufficient time to facilitate discussion, and uncover any remaining objection or correction to the proposal before objection voting begins.\n\n5. Objection Voting\n    1. Objection voting shall run for a minimum of 7 days, except for matters which present a clear, imminent danger to users, protocols, or the DAO.\n    2. The vote shall have two options, 'No objection' and 'Object', and shall include a prominent message explaining the difference between apparent consensus and majority voting.\n    3. Best effort shall be made to notify interested parties about the objection vote once it is live.\n    \n6. Ratification\n   1. If enough tokens select the 'Object' option at the close of the vote, the KIP does not have tokenholder consensus, and it returns to `draft` status. If there is a non-zero quorum requirement, and not enough tokens have selected the 'No objection' option, then the proposal is returned to `draft` status. Otherwise, the proposal is assigned `final` status.\n   2. The result of the vote shall be communicated via Discord and Twitter.\n\n## Sophons \n\nSophons are individuals empowered by the DAO to review, analyze, and publish non-binding recommendations on KIPs. They should \"speak for the protocol,\" rather than their own interests, and be knowledgeable about the subjects being considered. \n\nTheir role is to ensure that every KIP has been given adequate attention before it is put in front of tokenholders for a vote, and that tokenholders are provided with the opinion of qualified stakeholders in case they cannot judge for themselves.\n\n### Sophon onboarding process \n\nThis section defines a process for onboarding one or more Sophons. \n\nUse the template located at [KIP-0-T1.md](.\/KIP-0-T1.md).\n\n### Sophon offboarding process \n\nThis section defines a process for offboarding one or more Sophons.\n\nUse the template located at [KIP-0-T2.md](.\/KIP-0-T2.md)\n","protocol":"keeperdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x00fA720A0943Cc51145b78775d2A4B8B5d83EcCc","totalVotes":42,"blockNumber":13354794,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rook.eth\/proposal\/QmWwtAJA38AT3z7pUg9C1j6oGcWvAerw4nSa8byuxisMR4","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1633381200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1633986000}","startTimestamp":1633381200,"endTimestamp":1633986000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['No objection', 'Object']","results":"[{'total': 27817.59, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

This is a proposal to set up Kleros on xDai chain. The Kleros courts on xDai will initially resolve disputes generated on xDai but could potentially resolve bridged disputes in the future.\n\nIn order to have Kleros working on xDai, a KlerosLiquid contract has to be deployed with changes regarding PNK, randomness and upgradeability.\n\n## Kleros Token\n\nThe Mainnet Kleros token is already bridged on xDai. The address of the PNK on xDai is [0x37b60f4E9A31A64cCc0024dce7D0fD07eAA0F7B3 ](https:\/\/blockscout.com\/xdai\/mainnet\/address\/0x37b60f4E9A31A64cCc0024dce7D0fD07eAA0F7B3\/transactions) and you can get it through the [OmniBridge ](https:\/\/omni.xdaichain.com\/). However, the token contract available on xDai doesn\u2019t fit the KlerosLiquid contract, which requires a controller role so that it can lock and distribute rewards during disputes.\n\nTo solve this problem, instead of creating a new bridged PNK, the already existing xDai PNK will be wrapped with the proper requirements. Additionally, the wrapped PNK contract will be upgradeable.\n\n## Stake Incentives\n\nIn order to prevent the potential scenario in which too many PNKs are moved from Mainnet courts to xDai courts, only 10% of the [Juror Incentive Program](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/kleros\/proposal\/QmbMAahL4Xj2oM5cDaPKAW3n7yZKLoQWtuEJLMoWersUsN) funds (100,000 PNK per month) are going to be used for those staking on xDai. This should work both as an incentive for jurors to keep their PNK, or part of them, staked on Mainnet and as an incentive for jurors to move to xDai courts.\n\n## Randomness\n\nJurors are drawn randomly for each round of a dispute. KlerosLiquid on xDai cannot rely on the legacy random number generator used on mainnet, which works with block hashes. For this reason, RandomAuRa is going to be used instead. RandomAuRa is an official random number generator contract already available on xDai at address [0x5870b0527DeDB1cFBD9534343Feda1a41Ce47766 ](https:\/\/blockscout.com\/poa\/xdai\/address\/0x5870b0527DeDB1cFBD9534343Feda1a41Ce47766\/contracts). Random numbers are generated every N blocks, currently set at 76.\n\n## Upgradeability\n\nMaking the contract upgradeable will allow us to deploy quickly and adapt in the future along Kleros scalability roadmap.\n\nInitially, the contracts will be deployed by the Gnosis multisig instead of by the Kleros Governor and the courts won\u2019t be bridged with Mainnet. This means that arbitration will happen entirely on xDai. Notice that until this changes and because juror stake and activity is expected to be lower than on Mainnet, security and decentralization on xDai courts will be lower than on Mainnet courts. For this reason, this can be considered an experimental project. Omen on xDai will keep using the current bridge for passing disputes to Mainnet.\n\nFuture upgrades will make Kleros Governor the owner of xDai Kleros Liquid and jumps from xDai courts to Mainnet courts will be allowed in order to make the main Kleros the final arbitrator of disputes happening on xDai. Similarly, when Kleros Court v2 gets implemented and deployed on a optimistic or zk rollup, xDai courts could be bridged to the new version instead of the legacy one on Mainnet.\n\n## Juror Fees\n\nThe native xDai currency is going to be used for juror fees instead of ETH. Notice that this means that juror fees will be stable.\n\n## Courts and Parameters\n\nThe proposed parameters for xDai Kleros Liquid are the following (which are the same in Mainnet):\n\nminStakingTime : 3600\n\nmaxDrawingTime : 7200\n\nThe general court, which is created on deployment, will have the following parameters:\n\nname : xDai General Court\n\nhiddenVotes : false\n\nfeeForJuror : 15 xDai\n\nminStake : 520 PNK\n\nalpha : 0.5\n\njurorsForCourtJump : 511\n\ntimesPerPeriod : [280800,583200,583200,388800]\n\nsortitionSumTreeK : 6\n\nThe general court policy will be the same as the Mainnet general court.\n\nIn addition to the general court, a subcourt to resolve curate cases will be deployed with the following proposed parameters:\n\nname : xDai Curation\n\nparent: xDai General Court\n\nhiddenVotes : false\n\nfeeForJuror : 6.9 xDai\n\nminStake : 520 PNK\n\nalpha : 0.31\n\njurorsForCourtJump : 30\n\ntimesPerPeriod : [140400,291600,291600,194400]\n\nsortitionSumTreeK : 5\n\nThe curate court policy will be the same as the Mainnet curate court.\n\n## Resources\n\nThe wrapped PNK and the KlerosLiquid adaptation are already implemented at the time of writing and are going through the review process.

As you can see in the calculator, the parameters are calibrated for \u201ctypical\u201d gas prices of 150 gwei (and are constrained so that even at 200 gwei, average rewards are at least as high as the required gas to vote, etc). While these are lower than the highest peaks of gas one has observed recently, note that the voting periods are generally several days long, and these gas prices are relatively conservative compared to what has been recently necessary for non-instant confirmation times according to [https:\/\/www.gasnow.org\/ ](https:\/\/www.gasnow.org\/)\n\nNote that I also propose reducing the jurorsForCourtJump somewhat in the Blockchain and Blockchain Non-technical courts to make appeals to the general court somewhat more viable.

This looks good in absolute numbers and relative to liquidity (even with an infinite amount of capital, an attacker wouldn\u2019t find enough PNK for sale on exchanges to buy this much) but in term of % of the supply it\u2019s not that high (~14% of the supply is staked).\n\n# Extra incentives for staking\n\nJurors are already rewarded for their work with arbitration fees when they get drawn in a dispute. However simply staking in courts with a low amount of disputes per staked PNK (like the general court) doesn\u2019t provide a high amount of financial rewards while those stakers are still securing the system.\nWe\u2019ve seen with the recent trend of yield farming that providing tokens to stakers works in increasing the value staked (see [Uniswap ](https:\/\/uniswap.exchange\/) and [SushiSwap](https:\/\/sushiswapclassic.org\/) as the most prominent examples).\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose to set up a juror incentive program which will reward staked jurors in proportion of their stake.\nFor the year of 2021, jurors will receive a total of 1 000 000 PNK each month in proportion of the time and amount staked in this month.\n\nIn addition, any address which staked PNK before 01\/12\/2020 will receive a retroactive distribution of 1000 PNK.\n\nDetails:\n\n* The proposal is retroactive.\n* The tokens will be distributed using a Merkle Drop contract.\n* The distribution will start as soon as technically possible.\n* There may be a seasonality of the distribution (like once per week\/month).\n* The computation of rewards may use snapshots as long as those are taken at least once per day (i.e. if tracking every stake\/unstake events is not easy, it is possible to look at snapshots of staked balances and use those to determine how to split the rewards for that period of time).\n\n# Rationale\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to incentivize PNK holders to stake their PNK. At current values staked it would correspond to a 11% APY (labelled in PNK) for PNK staking. We expect this to drop (to a 1 digit value) as it would create extra incentives for staking and the total amount of PNK staked would increase diluting the rewards.\nIt would also improve the user experience of jurors staking small amount and not being drawn, often removing the negative feeling of \u201cstaking for nothing\u201d.\n\nThe 1000 PNK for every address which staked before December would give a small boost in the chances of being drawn for jurors with low stakes but who still demonstrated their interest participating. The amount stays modest to avoid incentivizing the creation of multiple addresses for the purpose of retroactive airdrops (i.e. expecting other projects to conduct similar airdrops and creating addresses for this purpose). The date is set before December as at this time no one had the knowledge that such proposal would be made.","protocol":"kleros","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x00B5ADe4ac1fE9cCc08Addc2C10070642335117F","totalVotes":107,"blockNumber":11729254,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/kleros\/proposal\/QmbMAahL4Xj2oM5cDaPKAW3n7yZKLoQWtuEJLMoWersUsN","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1611748800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1612353600}","startTimestamp":1611748800,"endTimestamp":1612353600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Accept', 'Reject']","results":"[{'total': 19227810, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

They will still provide liquidity to Balancer but the Cooperative will not have control over them nor will collect BAL rewards for this liquidity.*\n\n## Background\n\nCoop\u00e9rative Kleros provides funds to improve PNK pairs liquidity for a number of exchanges in both the centralized and decentralized space. One of those exchanges is Balancer, which currently has around 1.5M$ of Coop\u00e9rative Kleros funds providing both ETH and PNK to facilitate trading.\n\nOn August the 3rd 2020, one team member made an [erroneous transaction](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/tx\/0xbb26dbc1a8da0a136d95276bf6193244ca07075db8fbb8a9d56cfdd90571af90) resulting in a portion of Coop\u00e9rative Kleros&#39; liquidity being sent to an incorrect contract thus rendering it &#39;locked&#39; from withdrawal by the Cooperative. The team member in question resigned and has since been replaced.\n\nAlthough these funds are &#39;locked&#39; in name, they still provide liquidity to anyone using the Balancer exchange pool and would continue to do so into the future even if this proposal were to be rejected.\n\n We have, however, developed a recovery contract mechanism which, when activated by the governor, will return the funds to Coop\u00e9rative Kleros.\n\nNote that those funds were assigned to be used as liquidity anyway and are not needed for operational purposes. In fact, the [Cooperative treasury](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x67a57535b11445506a9e340662CD0c9755E5b1b4) has never been higher.\n\nAlso note that even if those funds were to be written-off (for the cooperative, but not for the ecosystem as they would still provide liquidity), the cooperative would still be overall profitable in its liquidity providing activities (mainly because of the 2M$ worth of UNI received).\n\n## Proposal\n\nGive [PNK](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0x93ed3fbe21207ec2e8f2d3c3de6e058cb73bc04d?a=0x67a57535b11445506a9e340662CD0c9755E5b1b4)&#39;s controller role to the [recovery contract](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x5f7c8c12ec3a545c71e56cb0609db769155d169e) at address 0x5F7C8c12ec3A545c71E56cb0609db769155d169E (note that etherscan verification is down but you can verify the [source code](https:\/\/github.com\/kleros\/balancer-funds-recovery\/blob\/0e0ac587c14a36bf5441eb6103ff4adb26bcf6a8\/contracts\/BalancerPoolRecoverer.sol) yourself). This role is required to perform the recovery and will be automatically restored after the operation.\n\nThe recovery contract will send the assets locked in the pool to the Coop\u00e9rative Kleros multisig wallet. The Coop\u00e9rative will then create a new pool on Balancer and give the liquidity tokens of this new pool to the previous pool owners\n\nThis will restore the lost funds.\n\n## Q &amp; A\n\n### Why can&#39;t Cooperative Kleros just do it?\n\nThe Cooperative cannot technically do it without using governance. The recovery contract requires an action from the [Kleros governor](https:\/\/governor.kleros.io\/kleros), thus a governance vote.\n\n### What would be the advantages of performing the recovery?\n\nCooperative Kleros would regain full control of the funds to use as it sees fit. There is currently no plan of removing the liquidity from Balancer. However, regaining control of this liquidity would allow the Coop\u00e9rative to benefit from BAL rewards and to potentially reallocate those funds for other purposes in the future.\n\n### What would be the issues with leaving them locked?\n\nThe main issue is that these funds would be permanently locked in the Balancer pool and would not be available for other Coop\u00e9rative operations. As it stands, although the funds are providing liquidity for the PNK token, the cooperative is not receiving BAL rewards which are instead burned.\n\nIf it were to regain control of the funds and add them correctly to the Balancer pool, it would then receive BAL rewards once more which can be added to the cooperative treasury.\n\n### What would be the actions performed by this recovery contract?\n\n- First, almost all the PNK stored in the Balancer pool would be pulled out. The right to do so would be temporarily granted to the recovery contract by the Governor contract.\n- Second, the recovery contract would swap the recovered PNK for WETH repeatedly, taking advantage of the imbalance in the Balancer pool.\n- Third, all recovered funds would be sent to Coop\u00e9rative Kleros and all rights over the PNK token would be restored.\n\n[Discussion](https:\/\/forum.kleros.io\/t\/kip-33-liquidity-recovery\/487)\n","protocol":"kleros","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x00B5ADe4ac1fE9cCc08Addc2C10070642335117F","totalVotes":24,"blockNumber":11434157,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/kleros\/proposal\/QmSrkSV2Teofkym5V59WTV4bsQnRK64rMGe2FF8vdAP8Lu","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1607774400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1608379200}","startTimestamp":1607774400,"endTimestamp":1608379200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Accept', 'Reject']","results":"[{'total': 23912496, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 6389269, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This framework will be the guidelines in which the DAO can operate to pay its contributors, if any amendments are needed they must undergo another community vote.\nTo ensure the longevity of the protocol, increase liquidity initiatives and to help fund future projects the DAO would like to increase the treasury revenue gained from bonding from 10% up to 30%. Note, increasing the fee will not negatively impact staking or bonding.\n\nAbstract:\nThe DAO has seen incredible growth in the amount of contributors since its inception. The protocol grew to an average market cap of over $100mm with over 80 contributors within 3 months of operation. Since then, the protocol has seen a contraction in market capitalization and with that a contraction in treasury KLIMA valuation. As stated in a recent Klima Medium Post, the DAO is focused on the continued development of the protocol. A formal framework is necessary to ensure fair and equitable compensation for sustained long-term growth and development.\n\nGiven the current market conditions, expected bond revenue, and amount of contributors within the DAO, the treasury only has a runway of approximately 3 months. This is based on the inflow of bonding revenue relative to the outflows from contributor allocations each month (assuming a price \/ Klima of $50). The DAO believes that continued contributor compensation is the best way to ensure protocol longevity and development. \n\nThe proposed framework has two key components to it:\n\n1. Department leads will be given an option to move toward vested KLIMA to help mitigate selling pressure and to allow for more immediate compensation to regular contributors\n\n2. Increase the amount of KLIMA that is distributed to the treasury to maintain current contribution levels\n\nIt is important to note that for every KLIMA that is minted for bonds, 0.1 KLIMA is minted for the DAO. For context, Olympus does 1 OHM for 1 KLIMA minted for the DAO. The DAO would like to increase this up to 0.3 KLIMA minted for 1 KLIMA minted for bonding. This extra KLIMA will be utilized for liquidity endeavors, contributor payout and any potential outsourcing of protocol work. The DAO treasury currently holds <30,000 KLIMA and the current payout per week to contributors is ~ 1.7k KLIMA.\n\nProposal: The DAO to adopt the formalized process and to increase the revenue gained from bonding to the treasury to up to 30%\n","protocol":"klimadao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x693aD12DbA5F6E07dE86FaA21098B691F60A1BEa","totalVotes":432,"blockNumber":24602474,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/klimadao.eth\/proposal\/0xa63e839bbde9160b779adcf53005d15a67c55b9174742e853711cf743834053a","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644120000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644379200}","startTimestamp":1644120000,"endTimestamp":1644379200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Adopt and Increase to 30%', 'Adopt and Increase to 20%', \"Don't adopt or increase\"]","results":"[{'total': 68725.336, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 21483.58, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 7078.5303, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

We feel that this liquidity pool has been made large enough today, $50m in BCT\/USDC. The utilization rate of this pool is consistently under 10%, which signals to the policy team that we have accomplished the goal of facilitating a carbon market for BCT in the short term.\n\nAt a high level, as we grow, we can expand liquidity vertically or horizontally.

Reduce the reward rate from 0.5% to 0.46% (22k APY%). \n\nMotivation:\nWhen KlimaDAO first launched, we had a reward rate of 0.5%, which equates to a WPY (Weekly Percentage Yield) of 8.54%, and an APY of 37-38k%. To incentivize people to join the KLIMA ecosystem, a high APY was necessary in order to attract people to invest in the protocol in its infancy. \n\nSince then, we\u2019ve obtained 11.3m BCT in the treasury, with a risk free value of 2.3m. We\u2019ve also increased our liquidity pools from 13m to 137m. We\u2019ve opened up the DAO, so that anyone can start contributing. Policy itself is made up largely of regular contributors that aren\u2019t part of the core team, making many of the bonding parameter decisions seen to date. \n\nTo become a carbon-backed reserve currency, two goals must be met: (1) a large supply to facilitate transactions, and (2) a large treasury in order to back each token, ensuring stability and confidence in the protocol. Our goal is to increase KLIMA\u2019s supply over the long run and, through integrations and mass adoption, become a decentralized reserve currency backed by carbon offsets. \n\nWhile expansion of the supply is one of the long term goals of KlimaDAO, doing so too quickly would be detrimental to our ability to generate revenue through bonding. In addition, as the supply increases exponentially, so does the revenue needed to maintain metrics such as the RFV\/KLIMA.  The Policy team must balance two types of supply emissions to ensure the long-term success of the protocol: the emissions from staking rewards and the emissions from bonding. Staking reward emissions form the majority of our supply growth, while the bonding emissions depend on many factors such as total supply, demand, and bond capacity variables set by the Policy team.  While the Policy team has been actively managing the supply growth through bonding, we believe it\u2019s time to (1) make the first adjustment to manage the supply growth occurring through staking rewards and (2) establish a framework for future adjustments to the same.\n\n\nProposal:\n\nWe propose a framework below, which gives the total supply of KLIMA, paired with the range of APY percentage we expect. Since staking reward emissions scale directly with total supply, it makes sense to base the reward rate itself off of total supply thresholds. We\u2019ve also indicated what phase we think that the Klima protocol is in when we\u2019re within these ranges: \n\nDiscovery (Seed)\n1 - 1,000,000 KLIMA -> 50,000% - 20,000% APY\n\nIntegrations (Sprout) \n1,000,000 - 10,000,000 KLIMA -> 30,000% - 2,000% APY\n\nAdoption (Sapling) \n10,000,000 - 100,000,000 KLIMA -> 3,000% - 200% APY\n\nStabilization (Adult)\n100,000,000 - 1,000,000,000 KLIMA -> 300% - 20% APY\n\nMaturity (Elder)\n1B-100B KLIMA -> 30% - 5% APY\n\nBrief Explanation of each phase: \n\nDiscovery: Protocol is very much in its infancy, with a single goal in mind: survive and prove itself. At this phase, we\u2019re very isolated, with no integrations, and focused on growth.\n\nIntegrations: Protocol has reached steady state, metrics are in a healthy range, and we\u2019ve grown enough for other projects to start integrating with us. Growth is still a focus. \n\nAdoption: At this point, the protocol has grown significantly, with many integrations, partnerships, and protocols building on top of us. At this point, people will start to use KLIMA as the go-to carbon currency, for companies to utilize to prove their commitment to sustainability. \n\nStabilization: Most of the growth has been realized at this point. Mass adoption and stability have been achieved. At this point, most of the efforts are focused on stabilization, to ensure that KLIMA remains in widespread use and becomes a unit-of-account.\n\nMaturity: The protocol has reached a state where stability is no longer a concern. At this stage, KLIMA becomes the symbol of fighting climate change and is synonymous with Carbon Credits, Sustainability, and Zero Emissions for countries.\n\nIt\u2019s critical to note that this is a FRAMEWORK AND GUIDELINE, and should be treated as such. All reward rate changes will still go through standard governance and will require a vote. This is simply to align the expectations of the Klimates with those of the Policy team.\n","protocol":"klimadao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xfa09ab0C96A37090e10706A0B5d95D1B1E81Fa4A","totalVotes":1257,"blockNumber":21679598,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/klimadao.eth\/proposal\/0xbe5ba88701e09fad2548ec2aca539b23cc04a5b7bc1961397fc98a0a303c5249","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637604000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637949600}","startTimestamp":1637604000,"endTimestamp":1637949600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Accept the Reward Framework', 'Decline the Reward Framework']","results":"[{'total': 72754.53, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1518.3303, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

As gOHM is not a carbon asset, we cannot use it for backing. However, the addition of a new rail of liquidity, and the demand from ohmies to bond vastly outweighs any downside\nUse 5 million in our treasury in order to bootstrap liquidity for the wsKLIMA\/gOHM pool, once the 7- day MA of the Klima treasury has reached 10 million.

Our plan was to launch with liquidity bonds only, bootstrapping the liquidity to sufficient levels before introducing BCT bonds. Since then, we have amassed over 34 million dollars in liquidity, split between the BCT\/USDC and KLIMA\/BCT pools. We believe now is the time to introduce BCT bonds as another method of absorbing carbon tonnage into the Treasury.\n\nAbstract: \nWe\u2019ve seen a massive on-boarding of BCTs on-chain. For reference, we expected 2 million to be on-boarded on day one, but we\u2019ve seen over 6.6 million minted so far, with more coming every day. \n\nThose who bridge BCTs on-chain have four options:\nBuy KLIMA for BCTs (increasing the premium of KLIMA);\nSell BCTs for USDC (decreasing the BCT premium);\nCreate KLIMA\/BCT SLP, bond it into the Treasury (increasing the KLIMA premium and adding liquidity); or\nCreate BCT\/USDC SLP, bond it into the Treasury (decreasing the BCT premium and adding liquidity).\n\nBCT bonds add an additional option for users and carbon bridgers to utilize their on-chain carbon offsets and get exposure to KLIMA without being affected by slippage. \n\nAdditionally, BCT bonds increase Treasury reserves much more efficiently compared to LP bonds. Currently, for KLIMA\/BCT liquidity, only 1\/20th can be used for backing (based on the Risk-Free Value formula). With BCT bonds, for every 1 BCT bonded, the Treasury receives 1 BCT for backing. This allows us to bolster the Treasury more efficiently, extend the runway, and provide a floor upon which KLIMA can build. \n\nMotivation:\nCapture BCT for the Treasury via BCT bonds, increasing runway, increasing demand for BCT, and encouraging further development of carbon offsets off-chain and bridging of such offsets on-chain. \n\nOther: \n1.

We plan to bring a range of facilitators initially to find a fit.

It can be destructive when we're stressed or running on empty.\n\nAs we\u2019ve experienced in Krause House, and in DAO\u2019s more broadly, change is constant, leaving us feeling in a constant state of transition. And it turns out, humans aren\u2019t naturally great at navigating transition and change - we get tense, stressed, and make emotionally driven decisions. Like the best NBA players, we need practice to stay in the moment, even when it gets heated. \n\nHaving a place to practice self-awareness and staying open under stress offers compound returns whether we take action or not.  We believe upskilling leaders within Krause House is an investment in:\n\n- Setting a healthy and constructive norm for how we relate and communicate that others can model.\n- Greater ability to hold healthy dispute and conflict as a means to collective intelligence.\n- Greater ability to address and constructively build from the frustration of community members.\n- Greater encouragement for new leaders to speak up and take leadership roles.\n- Greater sense of welcoming and acknowledgment for newcomers.\n- General vibe and tone of the community.\n\nEarly DAO contributors inevitably move into leadership roles as newcomers look to them for guidance and experience.  The weight and impact that our words and actions have on others increases with time, and we hope to give the leaders within Krause House the space and resources they need to grow.","protocol":"krausehouse","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x1983dA5059F7d7DA6b4c6cDc3D42D69a334A5E7E","totalVotes":2,"blockNumber":14186624,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/krausehouse.eth\/proposal\/0x35048ffc2b8763765f141d8486677cf803588ff16b2044d1b62bcdbd14ccbaa9","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644609600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644868800}","startTimestamp":1644609600,"endTimestamp":1644868800,"currentState":"active","choices":"['For', 'Postpone: Needs Edits', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 3000.06, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

By legitimate, we mean that the expense is conducted in the best interests of Krause House and is requested by someone who has some trust within the community.  For smaller asks, less scrutiny will be taken to minimize friction.\n\n### Example Scenarios:\n\n- Mario wants to spin up a Gitbook and messages Commodore for the OK, funds move over to him in 1-3 days instead of needing to move through Snapshot.\n- Eli spends gas setting up an ENS name for a Krause House production and messages Flex to get the OK, is quickly paid back.\n\n### Reversibility\n\nBy \u201cdelegated\u201d, we mean that these powers can be stripped or given to others.

Artists I\u2019ve worked closely with over the years include: Chance the Rapper, Aluna\/AlunaGeorge, Kacy Hill, Jessie Reyez, Daniel Caesar, and more.\n\n**SUMMARY:** \n\nThe goal of this project is to engage artists and influencers to find strategic partners to join Krause House and become \u201cambassadors\u201d in exchange for DAO governance tokens $KRAUSE.\n\n**GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nThe ideal Krause House ambassador is an artist or influencer who is a sports fan (especially if they\u2019re an NBA fan) and\/or engage in Web3 projects. Ideas for targets at the top level include Lil Wayne (who\u2019s a New Orleans native and a Pelicans fan) and Drake ([who has publicly pushed for a WNBA team in Toronto](https:\/\/www.si.com\/wnba\/2021\/11\/03\/drake-wnba-expansion-team-toronto)). We will also engage artists that have engaged in Web3 projects such as Diplo, DeadMau5, and more.\n\nThese aforementioned artists are the \u201cnorth star\u201d artists we will engage, but we also will look to find ways for artists and influencers of various sizes to be a part of Krause House and publicly support it through strategic social media and press campaigns.\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nThe NBA has adopted the idea of teams having official\/unofficial ambassadors from the music community as musicians bring strong cultural value to teams. Jay-Z & the Nets, Drake & the Raptors, Snoop Dogg & the Lakers, and 2 Chainz & the Hawks are all examples of artists who bring cultural value to NBA teams, and have strong ties to the local communities of the respective team\u2019s market.\n\nWhat\u2019s special about the DAO structure is that artists can now not only become ambassadors for a team, but also have ownership.\n\nThe exploratory aspect of this plan is to find out through conversations with various artists and managers what kind of compensation package artists at each level would look for to become an ambassador for Krause House. Through this exploratory phase, we will develop a tiered structure of compensation packages that will be used for future ambassadors.\n\nWe will also explore what kind of budget it will take to produce an event\/concert where artists (preferably ambassadors) perform to raise awareness for Krause House. We can also include panels, activations, etc.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nOver the course of two months, I will:\n\n1. Engage artist managers within my network to set up discussions about having the artists they work with being a part of Krause House and potentially an ambassador.\n2. Define what an ambassador\u2019s responsibilities would entail. This would include a combination of social posts, Twitter Spaces, Discord AMA, KH podcast appearance and a press release around the announcement of them joining as an ambassador. We want the ambassador to engage organically with whatever platforms they currently engage on, so it doesn\u2019t feel too \u201cshilly\u201d and feels authentic to their audience. The initial onboarding of an ambassador would include an agreed upon amount of social posting and engagements, and then as Krause House continues to develop and evolve, we would engage the ambassador to support where it feels authentic to them.\n3. Engage the Krause House community to get suggestions on who the ideal \u201cKrause House\u201d ambassadors could be.\n4. Work with the Full-time Contributors and NOLA Pelicans Bid team to identify New Orleans based artists that can help bring value to the community building aspect of the project and eventual Pelicans bid.\n5. Work with the Partnerships Team and Full-time Contributors to establish a compensation package for various levels of artists\/influencers that join Krause House and publicly support KH through social media posts and engagement.\n6. Submit new Snapshot proposals for ambassador compensation packages. Example: Lil Wayne coming on board as a Krause House artist ambassador in exchange for 10,000 $KRAUSE. \n7. Hopefully, begin to confirm Krause House\u2019s first artist ambassadors.\n8. Explore producing an event\/concert where artists (preferably ambassadors) perform to raise awareness for Krause House.\n\nAfter the 2 month period is over, I will look to refine the ambassador program strategy based on the findings from the initial period, and then propose a plan that will continue the work of onboarding strategic Krause House ambassadors based on the current roadmap and priorities.","protocol":"krausehouse","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x1983dA5059F7d7DA6b4c6cDc3D42D69a334A5E7E","totalVotes":17,"blockNumber":14148306,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/krausehouse.eth\/proposal\/0x63bdbf656dd4aed60f5117d3e73f0562b24d1c042f691b3ddbbed39abfe66307","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644102000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644361200}","startTimestamp":1644102000,"endTimestamp":1644361200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Postpone: Needs Edits', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 6896.493, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 5748.847, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

For future phases please TAL at the [1-Pager](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/KH-Analytics-Content-Platform-1-Pager-1009feec3e274323a45de894b2feb47d).\n\nPhase 1 consists of:\n\n- Create a public facing website to publish articles.\n- Build a brand around said website, even if it\u2019s only within KH.\n- Create an interface via KH to allow users to register for article generation in exchange for some form of compensation (can be manual, or tipping?)\n- Pick 1-2  article types that we believe has the highest cost to reward ratio.\n    - My thought atm is: Fantasy analysis and trade\/fa\/team analysis.\n- Onboard a couple of writers to help contribute.\n- 2-3 paragraphs in the newsletter.\n\n**DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\nPhase 1 success criteria includes:\n\n- Launch the website.\n- Recruit a core team of at least 4 writers.\n- Generate at least 5 articles per week (TBD on number).\n- Increase our visibility in KH public channels - create a highly visible space in our discord to post new articles.\n- Aim to average 50 views per article.\n- Figured out a compensation model for phase 2 that is better tied to quality of engagement.\n\n**FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\nUp to 500 $USDC will be allocated to article writers, depending on the quality of the article - decided by @Greg and @pod fog until specified otherwise. This is to encourage writers to write quality articles.\n\n- For longer form content, 50 $USDC will be allocated per article written (I timed myself writing one, it took about 90 minutes to do so).\n- For short form articles, 25 $USDC will be allocated per article.\n\n$KRAUSE allocation will occur at the end of the 4 week period.\n\n$KRAUSE allocation is contingent on articles passing a minimum bar of quality (no low effort content).\n\nAny remaining $USDC will be held in the Analytics House treasury. Additional $USDC distributed based on contributor\u2019s success in execution of the vision as part of the phase 2 proposal, after phase 1 has terminated. Some $USDC may be withheld to help execute future projects.\n\nCompensation structure will need iteration for future phases.\n\n**TEAM:**\n\nI come from a product engineering background, so I have firsthand experience in building a product and focusing on the user. This user oriented approach to analytics will help our content be accessible.\n\nTo be honest I don\u2019t have industry experience writing analytical content, but I\u2019m very well versed in cap rules and play a wide variety of fantasy related games. One of them is a multiplayer league in Basketball GM, which is effectively a GM simulation game for evaluating players and team situation, so I feel I have a decent grasp of value and team situations around the league.\n\nOur writing team will come from a wide background, and that\u2019s what will make it great! Because NBA fans also come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and look for different things when doing so.\n\n**OTHER RESEARCH OR NOTES:**\n\nThis is one of the core pillars of the higher level KH Analytical House vision, which can be found here: [https:\/\/www.notion.so\/krausehousework\/KH-Analytics-House-Vision-1-Pager-9ef78441f23446fab0d4cfd7ba9cc935](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/KH-Analytics-House-Vision-1-Pager-9ef78441f23446fab0d4cfd7ba9cc935)\n\nSeparate proposals will be created for the other two pillars once they have been sufficiently scoped out and thought through, potentially further down the line.","protocol":"krausehouse","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x1983dA5059F7d7DA6b4c6cDc3D42D69a334A5E7E","totalVotes":12,"blockNumber":14122615,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/krausehouse.eth\/proposal\/0x2c8cba8e80edb728c566b8a9483b0957ce6c6daeb7d7edafdb1c3618b25704e5","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643752800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644012000}","startTimestamp":1643752800,"endTimestamp":1644012000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 4780.1865, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2683.243, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Building Krause House wallet \/ dashboard with the initial features of a (1) token weighted forum to discuss Snapshot votes and (2) a place to create petitions for specific people or teams to sign off on.  I see this more generally as turning into a home where Jerry\u2019s can (1) perform a number of voting functions, (2) interact with KH smart contracts for commitment staking or token lockups for multipliers, (3) so many possibilities, the design space here is *huge*.\n2. Created Open Bounty Board + Discord Bot to help contributors and newcomers understand where they can provide value.\n3. Built Snapshot Discord Bot to keep voters up to date from within the Discord.\n4. Built Proposals Database Bot to pipe open proposals data into Discord (took offline, not sure if it\u2019s useful).\n5. Proposal reviews, working with contributors to edit\/improve proposals, managing Snapshot, and working to improve ease of proposals.  This includes experimenting with improved UX, including creating forms to help simplify the process and TL;DR versions of how governance works\u2014more to come.\n6. Working 1-on-1 with contributors to help them take leadership and initiate teams.\n7. Generally, and most importantly, whatever is needed \/ general gardening of the DAO.  Recruiting new talent, managing Discord, troubleshooting, fixing issues as they arise.\n\n### WAGBAT","protocol":"krausehouse","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x1983dA5059F7d7DA6b4c6cDc3D42D69a334A5E7E","totalVotes":20,"blockNumber":14075808,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/krausehouse.eth\/proposal\/0xbc829784192a8122d3264b71b5f1d6df0246782a687aedb0de4497737231833e","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643130000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643389200}","startTimestamp":1643130000,"endTimestamp":1643389200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 273606.66, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 200, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Canada, Australia, UK.\n    1. This will be done through interviews with league offices and franchise operators around the world. Please share contacts with these individuals if you have contacts you believe we should be including our interviews.\n- Analyze professional basketball franchises (via a series of interviews) in 8 cities that may be ideal targets for KH. Providing the KH group with a summary of the economic, technological and \u201cfan\/community\u201d related opportunities and challenges associated with franchise ownership in these markets.\n- Propose next steps. Including entry points for entering into franchise ownership discussions. Recommend executive roles & skillsets that will be needed to negotiate the purchase of an international team.\n    - Once established this global following will have a vested interested in seeing Krause House succeed on the ultimate goal of \u201cBuying an NBA team\u201d. This global following will be an important asset as we engage with the NBA league office, existing governors, and the ecosystem of operators around the NBA.\n\n**DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\n*List of measurable KPIs that will determine projects success in the next 30 days*\n\n1. Identify a list of 3 potential franchises for Krause House purchase consideration\n2. Provide an overview of the operational opportunities and challenges for Krause House associated with international professional basketball team ownership\n3. Recommend a strategy, roles, responsibilities and skill sets necessary to succeed in the acquisition and operation of a franchise.\n\n**FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\nRequesting 500 $KRAUSE as a base compensation to complete the work described in the \u201cDefinition of Success?\u201d section above.\n\nIn addition we are requesting the following milestone-based compensation for providing the following:\n\n1500 $KRAUSE for completed interview video\/written transcript with top official (owner\/GM) for an international franchise. Maximum 3000 $KRAUSE as evaluated by the Stewards Team.\n\nWe intend to conduct as many interviews as possible. Video\/written transcripts will be produced to provide context of conversations, including descriptions of challenges and opportunities related to operating a professional franchise in selected markets.\n\n**TEAM:**\n\n*`Why will you succeed? What is your expertise, experience, or ethos?`*\n\nOur committee will deliver a comprehensive report to the Krause House members that will: \n\na) Provide clarity around the state of international basketball franchise ownership as it relates to Krause House\u2019s mandate to test the Decentralized Sports Organization thesis before embarking on the NBA team ownership path \n\nb) Report on the pros and cons of Krause House ownership of specific franchises based on interviews conducted with senior level team and basketball officials across several leagues, and \n\nc) Provide a recommended path forward if the KH member community decides to pursue our recommendations. \n\n**Committee Leadership \/ Team Members:** \n\nThe committee is lead by a former senior level executive, chief digital officer, at Canada\u2019s longest operating professional basketball league, NBL Canada. In addition to his role at the NBL Canada our lead is employed by a leading Web2 digital solutions company where he works closely with c-suite executives at the NBA league office and its community of franchises, helping to drive strategies for fan engagement programs, which are now seeing the opportunity and potential disruption related to Web3, NFT\u2019s and play to earn gaming. \n\n2 of our committee members have played professional basketball internationally at the highest levels - at some of the top leagues in the world - where we intend to explore franchise opportunities and schedule leader interviews. Including: *Canada, Australia, Italy, France*, and the *NBA summer league*. \n\nBoth of these committee members have relationships in place with team and league executives around the world that will help to speed the time it takes to schedule and complete the interviews that will inform our report and recommendations. \n\nThe committee is made up of committed WAGBAT\u2019s that believe the international franchise ownership path may be the perfect testing ground for Krause House\u2019s Web3 centric form of fan ownership and fan engagement. We plan to provide a complete, informed perspective for our fellow token holders to assess and understand this opportunity before deciding on a path forward. **#WAGBAT**","protocol":"krausehouse","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xea0774226d998a2f513c3698901869189195C1b5","totalVotes":41,"blockNumber":14071359,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/krausehouse.eth\/proposal\/0x06b940a83866c6daa7a02eb1f066f4a52bcf8e56848ec88f3e4942d8f2d3aa15","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643067900}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643327100}","startTimestamp":1643067900,"endTimestamp":1643327100,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 37594.113, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 100, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Krause House is a decentralized organization with a supportive culture. We believe that every NBA fan has the opportunity to be a part of owning a team. As such, we want to make Krause House open, not only to those who are able to purchase tickets, but also to those who are willing to make meaningful contributions to improve the DAO. This proposal focuses on engaging those individuals who want to contribute via individual bounty tasks vs being part of an existing KH Team.\n\nHOW THIS WILL BE DONE:\n\nWe propose establishing and communicating a Bounty Program outside the gated area where potential contributors can come and sign up to perform key tasks that earn them $KRAUSE tokens. A Bounty Bot will automate the process and update daily. Team leads will be able to add bounties to the list. The Bounty Program will be shared as part of the Draft Class process, clearly outlined in the Public discord section and communicated through social media. Interested members will be able to sign up and complete bounties for $KRAUSE. \n\nDEFINITION OF SUCCESS:\n\nSuccess will be measured by 1) the number of bounty opportunities created by team\/project leads and 2) the number of people who \u201capply\u201d for these bounties. Our goal is to see a minimum of 50% of available bounty projects completed by non-ticketed individuals. We will track participation to determine success.\n\nFUNDING DETAILS:\n\nWe are requesting 5,000 $KRAUSE to fund approximately the first ~25 project bounties.\n\nWe are also requesting $500 USDC and 250 $KRAUSE for Dluxe to set up this program & maintain the bounty board (with assistance from Mario).\n\nBounties can fall into 3 categories, based on time commitment \n(Free Throw<5 hrs work 100 $KRAUSE; Jump Shot 5-20 hrs work 200 $KRAUSE; 3-Pointer > 20 hrs work 350 $KRAUSE).*** \n\nHere is an example bounty list for launch.

The approach here is more exploratory as structure\/processes still need to be fine-tuned. Future proposal(s) will be submitted once partnership agreements are made and there is a clear understanding of what the appropriate means of funding should be. This is meant to answer unknown questions, and additional proposals will be used to execute on those answers.\n\n**Unique Value Proposition for KH**\n\nIf successful, this ongoing project of securing partnerships will give KH added brand recognition, membership growth\/engagement, and increased treasury funds. Additional ways to potentially overdeliver value back to the KH community may include:\n\n- Discover new DAO tooling (ie Wonderverse)\n- Develop strong web3 relationships\n- Exclusive perks for members\n- Enhance recruiting strategy\n\n**Accountability**\n\nI, @ritzleroy, would like to lead this team to build out this project, along with @liamherbst_. We currently have 8 other KH members interested in Partnerships to assist with research, inbound filtering, tooling, messaging, team structuring, deal flow, and inbound\/outbound strategies.\n\nWe will hold weekly sync sessions to discuss the current pipeline, delegate categories to pursue and accounts for members to hold individual responsibility, collaborate with other KH team members for various partnership initiatives, and set goals with hard deadlines to ensure task completion.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nIf this proposal is accepted, we\u2019ll need to do a few rounds of iteration. The focus will be primarily on the below, and from there we will be able to determine appropriate compensation structures and timelines.\n\nBy the end of **3** weeks, we will aim to have definitive answers on:\n\n1. CRM tooling\n2. Messaging\n3. Deal flow\n4. Partnership priorities\n5. High level team structure\n6. Inbound\/outbound strategies\n\nI, @ritzleroy, propose a lump sum in the amount of 3,500 $KRAUSE to be paid to contributors once all of the below deliverables are met.

","content":"---\n\nNote: This proposal is a modification of a [previous proposal](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/krausehouse.eth\/proposal\/0xefc34ecb85d70ba96f56dbebd71e7787cf4e13fefd6ffc09fa3d9832e0054cc7) updated according to community feedback.\n\n---\n\n### Summary \nWe envision Krause House being a major owner (and the brand) behind a top-tier Rumble Kong Club. We envision this Club as a sub-DAO of Krause House, with its own token (liquid ownership). This will allow us to build a strong community and treasury for the Club to be used to aggressively attack Club operations and management. We envision the KH RKL Club signing top Kongs, partnership with big brand sponsorships, driving revenue, captivating a fanbase, and ultimately - winning championships. Owning and managing a digital franchise is an important iteration for Krause House while on it\u2019s path to buying ownership stakes in IRL franchises.\n\nWhile this is a lofty vision, it starts with acquiring a RKL Club NFT, which is the focus of this proposal. It is intended for future proposals to focus on launching a work stream for all the effort that will be required to establish the Club. But for now, the best path forward (as we explore the sub-DAO design space for both regulatory and effectiveness purposes) is to propose that the KH Treasury funds the acquisition of a RKL Club in the first auction (Q1 2022).\n\nWe propose that the Krause House Treasury deploys up to 30 ETH in acquiring a RKL Club NFT in the upcoming Q1 2022 auction. In time, a subDAO structure may be proposed and it is likely that external capital will be raised - it is intended that KH could be paid back up to 100% of the cost of the acquisition of the RKL Club NFT.\n\n### Background\nRumble Kong League (RKL) is the metaverse\u2019s basketball league. Rumble Kong\u2019s are programmatically generated, unique (10,000) NFTs that represent playable avatars. Each Kong has built-in stats\/skills as well as visual rarities. The RKL team just raised $4.5m to continue to create the premier play-to-earn sports game. Rumble Kong\u2019s rank #15 in trade volume on OpenSea over the past 7 days. Steph Curry and Paul George are among the NBA players that have now purchased a Kong. \n\nRKL recently announced the launch of Clubs. Clubs will be at the center of gameplay and the play-to-earn economy within RKL. Individual Kongs will sign on-chain contracts with Clubs. Clubs will deploy teams to play in different divisions. Thus, the revenue flow within the game flows through Clubs. Clubs will be major brands, sign sponsorship deals, create merchandise, and build fanbases.\n\nJust as IRL franchises are in our sights, digital franchises should be as well.\n\n### Value Proposition\nBroadly, we have a lot to explore and learn as we pursue our goals of purchasing and managing stakes in sports franchises:\n- Regulatory structures\n- Fundraising\n- Value transfer to\/from Krause House\n- Governance\n- Management\n- Community\n\nAn RKL Club will allow us to experiment with all. Specifically, we want to highlight how an RKL Club aligns with the vision, mission, and values of the Krause House DAO across sports operations, governance, brand & community, and treasury. \n\n##### Sports Operations\nAn RKL Club gives us a lower-risk environment (thinking on the scale of hundreds of thousands of dollars vs tens of millions of dollars) to explore, iterate, and learn how to operate a sports franchise. RKL Clubs will need all of the following functions:\n\n- Scouting\n- Analytics\n- General Management\n- Coaching\n- Brand \/ Design\n- Social\n- Merchandise\n- Partnerships \n- Sponsorships\n- Events\n\n\nThere is quite a bit about the game that is still to be determined (see the whitepaper). We know that Clubs will sign on-chain contracts with players. Clubs will be responsible for managing rosters and fielding teams in leagues. Clubs will sign partnerships and sponsorships within the metaverse. Clubs will build brands, community, and fanbases. Clubs will seek to win championships and hang banners and trophies.\n\nAll of the functions in the list above overlap directly with operations that will need to exist in the management of an IRL team (shoutout to the group working on the Decentralized Sports Operations (DSO) Stream proposal). Obviously there will be differences - this is not an IRL team. However, an RKL Club can be a go-to option for testing hypotheses and running experiments as we build out capabilities to manage an IRL team.\n\n##### Governance\nHow will governance flow into sports operations? Will there be a layer of base token voting? On what decisions? What will be delegated off of governance and onto specific roles (i.e. GM, or Coach)? There are a lot of open questions around the best structures to marry fractional ownership and governance of a sports franchise with the actual management of the sports franchise. \n\nGovernance is already difficult within Web3 and DAOs. By the time KH buys IRL stakes, we better have some strong governance and management primitives ready to employ - an IRL stake is not the best for experimentation given the high stakes associated. An RKL Club lets us start working in the governance design space immediately, maybe even running through multiple iterations.\n\n##### Brand & Community\nIt is an incredible opportunity to build our brand and expand our community. As of now, RKL is the premier P2E sports game opportunity. Having a strong brand presence within RKL will help us build legitimacy as a brand and community, as well as build partnerships that extend beyond RKL and into our IRL efforts. \n\nBuilding brand and community seem to be focus points for KH DAO at this point in time - an RKL Club will be one of the highest leverage activities for building brand and community within the metaverse (55.2k current members in the RKL discord). \n\n##### Treasury\nWhile the economic flywheels within RKL have yet to be released, assets within the RKL ecosystem (such as Kongs and Clubs) are a risk-on Treasury diversification strategy at the core. When combined with a broader Treasury strategy that is more conservative, this is precisely the type of opportunity where we should be willing to take on some risk - buying and operating a digital franchise is directly aligned with the mission, vision, and values of the DAO.\n\n### Execution\nThe end game is a grand vision. We must break it down in order to work effectively and at speed, but also ensure we stay within regulatory bounds. At the core, we see a succession of stages getting us moving towards the end vision. A hypothetical path could look like:\n\n1. Purchase RKL Club NFT\na. A separate multi-sig will be created. It will require 3\/5 signatures and will be comprised of: jdcook, commodore, flex, eli, and lewwwk (proposal author and 4 stewards)\nb) Funds will be transferred from the KH Treasury to the multi-sig.\nc) Multi-sig will participate in the auction. After the auction, any remaining funds will be sent back to the KH Treasury.\n2. Establish KH RKL Club Workstream\n3. Launch sub-DAO with crowdfund\na. Pay back KH up to its desired ownership stake\nb. Extend the ownership and community of the RKL Club\n4. Create governance structures\na. Imagine GM, Coach, Scout, etc NFTs all with management voting rights and token holders determining who is \u201chired\u201d and gets to hold those NFTs (as an example)\n5. Build up Club\na. Brand\nb. Roster\nc. Management\n5. Win championships\n\nTo be explicitly clear, this proposal is just for purchasing the RKL Club NFT. While we have a larger vision around a subDAO structure eventually, the path that gives us the most flexibility while also letting us move fast here is having the Krause House Treasury acquire the Club NFT in the Q1 2022 auction.\n\nAfter purchasing a Club NFT, the top priority will be getting a workstream proposal passed to drive the next stages of establishing the Club. It is envisioned that this work team will take on the responsibility of researching the potential options we can take to building and governing the RKL Club, as well as executing on a decided path and getting the Club into a formal governance structure. Also, this work team may take on the responsibility of creating branding and design for the Club, instantiating Club socials, and introducing the Club to the world. The workstream proposal will dictate the final mandates for the team.\n\nAt this point in time, our belief is that a sub-DAO model will be the best approach for the Club. Some of the reasons being:\n\na) we can extend the ownership community beyond KH, thus extending the KH community\nb) we create more flexibility when developing offers for managers and Kongs to sign with our Club\nc) we can build a larger treasury without draining KH treasury funds (through crowdfund)\nd) we can build governance structures for the Club independently from KH\n\nHowever, we want it to be very clear that the purpose of any subsequent workstream will be to fully explore and evaluate the options (including a sub-DAO model) we have for establishing and growing the Club in a way that is: responsible; aligned with the mission, vision and values of the DAO; and is compliant with market and regulatory contexts. We are not committing to a sub-DAO model at this time, but rather indicating this is the leading vision. A leading alternative would be keeping the Club 100% within KH and figuring out governance and management structures within KH for the Club.\n\nIn time, if a subDAO structure is formed, it is likely that external capital will be raised - it is intended that KH can be paid up to 100% of the cost of the acquisition of the RKL Club NFT if we pursue this path. If we determine that it is best to keep the RKL Club 100% within KH, the cost of the NFT will never be paid back, but more value\/revenue will flow back to KH.\n\n### Team\n@jdcook#7279\n@josephdcook\nKrause House Club Level \/ Top 20 Holder of $KRAUSE\nOwner of Kong #1183\nHead of Analytics & Index Council @ Index Coop\n\n@jackjack#9795\n@saxyjacky\nEarly Krause House member \/ Running KH Website project\nOwner of Kong #7701\n10 year creative advertising vet.

Steph Curry and Paul George will loan their Kongs to our Club. The top sponsors will be fighting for naming rights to the KH RKL Arena. The KH RKL Club token will have the highest valuation of any Club. We will hang trophies and banners.\n\n### Proposal\nWe propose that the Krause House Treasury deploys up to 30 ETH in acquiring a RKL Club NFT in the upcoming Q1 2022 auction. \n\nA separate multi-sig will be created. It will require 3\/5 signatures and will comprise: jdcook, commodore, flex, eli, and lewwwk (proposal author and 4 stewards). \n\nFunds will be transferred from the KH Treasury to the multi-sig. Multi-sig will participate in the auction. After the auction, any remaining funds will be sent back to the KH Treasury.\n\nIn the case where the auction does not support Wallet Connect (needed for a multi-sig to participate). We propose that funds are sent to Commodore to participate in the auction on behalf of KH. The same transfer conditions (paragraph above) apply to this process as well. Commodore is a trusted individual within KH and has a significant stake in KH. Both of which should eliminate concern of malicious behavior if this path needed to be taken.\n\nThe purchase of the RKL Club via this proposal is non-binding. Meaning, the multi-sig retains the option to remove itself from the auction and return all funds to the Treasury if at any point it is deemed un-wise to move forward with the purchase of an RKL Club.\n\n","protocol":"krausehouse","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x1983dA5059F7d7DA6b4c6cDc3D42D69a334A5E7E","totalVotes":47,"blockNumber":14006597,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/krausehouse.eth\/proposal\/0xe86bb69b4848f46bed09065453bf2c8515e3f984f2857a35e4f1c7b3cd10dd6f","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642222800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642482000}","startTimestamp":1642222800,"endTimestamp":1642482000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 82654.195, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 13313.578, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 1390.92, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

There is only an unofficially seeded LP on Uniswap V3. \n\n## **WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nCurrently, on Uniswap-V3 there is ~$47.8k worth of liquidity for KRAUSE\/ETH, unfortunately, even if community members wanted to provide liquidity with their KRAUSE and ETH, they would have seen horrifying IL over the last ~1month. \n\nWe propose that KRAUSE apply for whitelisting from the Bancor DAO, and request a **500k $BNT (~$1.6m)** co-investment from the Bancor DAO (subject to DAO vote for whitelisting x co-investment) - this would allow the KRAUSE token to have deeper liquidity. \n\nAnother unique advantage to LP\u2019ing on Bancor is that the protocol has an amazing program wherein users who LP, do not suffer from IL whatsoever. There are also some additional benefits once Bancor V3 is released later in January, which protects LP\u2019s from IL from Day 1. \n\nIn doing so, Krause House DAO deepens its liquidity and protects its community by offering it the best option for liquidity provision in DeFi.\n\n## **HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nOnce whitelisting is approved (if approved), the treasury would bootstrap the pool with 1,000 BNT worth of KRAUSE (1 BNT at $4.33 = $4,330, so $4,330 worth of KRAUSE). \n\nSnapshot for any proposal goes live every Sunday morning at `11:00 am EST.` Voting is open until Wednesday at `2:00 pm EST`. 1-2 days after the proposal passes, Krause House DAO treasury will bootstrap the pool.\n\n## TIMELINE:\n\nIf this proposal is to pass quorum, the team outlined in this document shall push for the whitelisting process at their discretion.\n\n## BANCOR - What is it?\n\nBancor introduced the first AMM on Ethereum in 2017. Bancor V1 was designed to solve the liquidity problem where thin order books struggled to guarantee liquidity to investors on either side of a trade. The success of AMM\u2019s exposed some key downsides to Liquidity Providers such as Involuntary Token Exposure and Impermanent Loss. \n\nBancor V2.1 offers a solution to the above-mentioned problems:\n\n1. Single-Sided Exposure\n2.

To be paid out in a lump sum after the refresh is launched. This allocation of $KRAUSE will be distributed to the following contributors:\n\n- 75% Jackjack - for refresh content strategy, wireframes, design explorations, website dev\/setup and project management.\n- 10% BigBully.eth - for content strategy and copywriting.\n- 10% Peacenode.eth - for illustration design.\n- 5% Greg | Dev \/ UX - for design explorations.\n\n**GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nTo launch a website refresh for krausehouse.club. The project was started in S1 and carried over to S2. There was work done previously, including website content strategy, design explorations, copy development and wireframing. We\u2019re now at a point where we\u2019ve built out a page that\u2019s close to being ready (staging link: https:\/\/krause-house.webflow.io\/). We\u2019re working on the final touches, and aim to have that ready to go live in the upcoming weeks. This proposal is to create a workstream to compensate the team for the work previously done for the website refresh and for the work needed to finalize the refresh for launch.\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nThe website is what most new users see when they first hear about Krause House. It\u2019s our shot to make a great first impression and show interested people that we\u2019re committed to the mission and are legitimate. The site should reflect the look and feel that we\u2019ve established, and serve as an educational resource for users to learn more about KH before jumping into the discord or purchasing a ticket\/$KRAUSE.\n\nThe current Krausehouse.club website is more of a directory than a consumer facing website. The website refresh will help create a user-friendly website experience for new users, and will be a better tool for education and help funnel new users to the right destination.\n\nThere is a Phase 2 proposal in the works for the larger website redesign - that proposal will focus on what features and functionality we think is best to include on the website. The goal will be to build a robust website that incorporates different aspects for what the DAO is doing and offer another platform outside of the discord for members to work in. We\u2019ll go through a proper scoping and planning phase here to determine what those features and functionality should be.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nA nimble internal team composed of JackJack, BigBully.eth and Peacenode.eth are working to finalize the refresh. A staging link ([https:\/\/krause-house.webflow.io\/](https:\/\/krause-house.webflow.io\/)) has already been established with the WIP. Once we have finalized the remaining pieces (vetted copy and visual illustrations), we\u2019ll be in a spot to run the refresh by the steward team for final approval.\n\nThe following work has already been completed for the refresh:\n\n- Content strategy and planning (work found on our collab board: [link](https:\/\/miro.com\/app\/board\/o9J_lsiEHRw=\/))\n- Lo fidelity wireframes (found in the collab board, direct [link](https:\/\/miro.com\/app\/board\/o9J_lsiEHRw=\/?moveToWidget=3074457368043770546&cot=14))\n- Design + Illustrations explorations and development (found within the KH Website channel on the Discord)\n- Copy Development ([link](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1I-mM2YQeWi22rqhHHmkNkPppyXrQei6qxNPwD_w7QBc\/edit?usp=sharing))\n- Staging site setup and development ([https:\/\/krause-house.webflow.io\/](https:\/\/krause-house.webflow.io\/))\n\nOnce approved, we\u2019ll need to register for a webflow.io premium account ($35\/month) and initiate the domain redirect to the site. Additional users can be created to have access and edit ability to the site.\n\nAfter the refresh is launched, we\u2019ll pivot the workflow to focus on the larger website redesign project: the Phase 2 proposal.\n\nProject lead: JackJack\nSupport: Bigbully.eth\n","protocol":"krausehouse","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x1983dA5059F7d7DA6b4c6cDc3D42D69a334A5E7E","totalVotes":44,"blockNumber":14006573,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/krausehouse.eth\/proposal\/0xd17f3dbdbcc335fdf269fdf75d09cb5315df9dbb541793c214443df0b256796d","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642222800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642482000}","startTimestamp":1642222800,"endTimestamp":1642482000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Abstain']","results":"[{'total': 39671.742, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 5454.39, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Since there is no official management of the Chinese channel to communicate and answer questions in Chinese, and there is no person in charge to collect questions and communicating with core team members. These are the main reasons for the current situation.*\n\n*We believe that we can effectively solve the above problems, express the main goals and values of KrauseHouse, which means we can successfully participate in the management and ownership of NBA teams through DAO. Helps Chinese channels to form a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of DAO, and dispel the misunderstanding of DAO in the past. We believe that DAO is not limited to regions, time zones, or countries, and this proposal will better help KH DAO to build a comprehensive and diverse organizational

It is made up of three distinct blockchains: the Exchange Chain (X-Chain), the Platform Chain (P-Chain), and the Contract Chain (C-Chain).\n\n### Limitations of Current Avalanche Technology\n\nSmart contracts are executed on the C-Chain, however staking is performed on the P-Chain, which cannot run custom smart contract code.\n\nBecause Avalanche does not yet enable smart contracts to transfer AVAX between chains or to perform staking on the P-Chain, it is not currently possible for a smart contract to move tokens between these chains, meaning that some amount of the process must be custodial to begin with.\n\nWe propose a two-stage roadmap, combining the best of what is possible today, with a path to improvements in automation and trust minimisation as Avalanche grows. Both stages assume the creation of an Avalanche C-Chain token (stAVAX), representing staked versions of AVAX. At all stages, code will be open sourced and shared with the community.\n\n### Interim Solution: Semi-Custodial Liquid Staking\n\nAs with Lido stETH, tokens will accrue rewards as a function of time, removing the need for users to sacrifice liquidity or meet minimum staking value requirements to be able to participate in Avalanche\u2019s growing DeFi ecosystem. Additionally, governance over selected validators, fees, other parameters, and matters such as upgrades to the protocol will be carried out by LDO holders.\n\nIn the initial version, the subset of operations which cannot yet be managed by smart contracts (such as cross-chain transfers and staking) will be carried out via operations requiring multi-party approval. These approaches will then be phased out as the Avalanche blockchain matures.\n\n### Long-Term Solution: Trustless Liquid Staking\n\nThe next update to Avalanche (Blueberry) intends to improve cross-chain transfer functionality, with work commencing in Q4 2021. We intend to work closely with Ava Labs to build on this and help add functionality to enable automated cross-chain staking with minimized trust.\n\nThis will require a number of improvements to Avalanche to better support cross chain messaging and querying, interchain accounts, remote transfers, and ultimately staking from contracts on the C-Chain.\n\n## Timeline estimates\n\nPreliminary work:\n\n* Research and development (October-January 2021)\n* Initial tech spec (January 2021-February 2022)\n\nPhase 1: semi-custodial liquid staking\n\n* Development: includes custom MPC solution (January-May 2022)\n* Fuji testnet deployment and audit (April-May 2022)\n* Mainnet deployment (June 2022)\n\nPhase 2: trustless liquid staking\n\n* Avalanche protocol development\n* Trustless staking development\n* Fuji testnet deployment and audit\n* Mainnet deployment\n\nMigration:\n\n* Migration of v1 users \/ custodied funds to v2; maintenance, upgrades and support for v2 and planning for further iterations\n\n\n## Compensation\n\nWe believe in the long term success and value proposition of Lido, and are therefore eager to propose a two-part incentive structure that shows our commitment both to this project and to the alignment of our respective interests.\n\nThis proposal contains a significant amount of development work, including an interim MPC solution, which contributes to the Lido codebase as a general purpose secure custodial solution, as well as protocol-level development to enhance the cross chain communication on Avalanche.\n\nIn this particular implementation for Avalanche, we will tackle the full complexity of the threshold ECDSA, which is more difficult than other setups such as BLS. We foresee a lot of learning and development from this proposal can be applied to other blockchains in the future since these are common challenges for a secure liquid staking solution.\n\nFirst, we would propose incentives of LDO tokens with the following terms:\n\n* The initial grant is issued immediately. Subsequent grants are issued when Lido for Avalanche captures % market share, based on the table below.\n* A grant given on the basis of delivering Phase 2 of the proposal, which represents a significant amount of potentially uncompensated work on the Avalanche protocol in tandem with the Ava Labs team.\n\nWe strongly believe this latter phase will benefit Lido, due to the optics of giving back to the Avalanche developer community and improving the protocol (i.e. supporting trustless inter-chain movements) for all teams working in Avalanche DeFi.\n\n|Milestone|LDO|\n| --- | --- |\n|Initial grant, covering delivery of Phase 1|350,000|\n|1% market share|200,000|\n|2%|200,000|\n|3%|200,000|\n|4%|200,000|\n|5%|200,000|\n|10%|500,000|\n|Delivery of Phase 2|150,000|\n|**Total**|**2,000,000 LDO**|\n\nWe define \u201cmarket share\u201d as the ratio between the amount of staked AVAX tokens via Lido vs. that of all staked AVAX tokens (currently around 60% of supply), based on Avalanche\u2019s [Validator Stats](https:\/\/www.avax.network\/validators) page. To qualify, the given market share must be held on average across at least 30 days, to account for variability in the data.\n\nIn addition, we propose that audit during the initial grant phase be compensated separately by Lido, and that the Hyperelliptic Labs x RockX team receive 20% of the ongoing Lido treasury fees from this solution, in order to align both parties\u2019 incentives.\n\nAn ongoing revenue share plays many roles, including rewarding the team for the success of the project, and in order to cover the costs of ongoing maintenance, improvements, and integrations, both of the solution itself, and of a secure MPC key management system.\n\n## Project Team\n\nThe project will be jointly carried out by the Hyperelliptic and RockX teams, both of whom will bring their respective strengths to bear on this project.\n\nRockX is an institutional staking service provider, which has been a node operator of stETH and stSOL under Lido. Besides offering institutional staking services and stable access nodes. The team has a research arm X-matrix labs, which specializes in improving defi protocols and developing MPC key management (including DKG, resharing and signing)\n\nThe Hyperelliptic Labs team specializes in infrastructure, security and cryptographic key management. The team comes from both crypto and tradfi backgrounds, having built products used by millions of people around the world.\n\nWe are in close contact with both core Avalanche and Lido development teams, and look forward to collaborating with them to deliver this solution.","protocol":"lido","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xC8381ca290c198F5ab739A1841Ce8aeDb0b330D5","totalVotes":33,"blockNumber":14132751,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/lido-snapshot.eth\/proposal\/0xfe5b203c3c250971361ea77b2a9e254ea64c46fb6566598d681e9d2dad8b133f","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643878800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644483600}","startTimestamp":1643878800,"endTimestamp":1644483600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yay', 'Nay']","results":"[{'total': 27923738, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 829981.4, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

While joining the WG does signal an intent to participate in the Flashbots ecosystem post-Merge, this is a non-binding commitment and this vote is solely to determine whether the DAO agrees to join the WG or not. \n\nFurther governance discussions and votes will follow, which will serve to clearly indicate the DAO\u2019s chosen strategy with regards to MEV extraction (e.g. \u201cDoes Lido agree to participate in the extraction of MEV?\u201d, \u201cAre Lido Node Operators all in alignment?\u201d) and which mechanism(s) will be utilized for extraction and reward distribution.\n\n\n### Details\nThe purpose of joining the WG is to help Lido explore and answer a series of questions with regards to how Lido will approach MEV generally in the future. Specifically, Lido\u2019s involvement in the WG would be focused on mechanisms surrounding how MEV-bearing blocks will be created, communicated, and proposed, as well as how fees and rewards will be distributed across the relevant stakeholders.\n\nAs the Merge approaches, it behooves Lido to understand the technical and operational activities that would be required for the DAO and relevant node operators to undertake in order to participate in such a mechanism, whether these activities can be managed and implemented in an open and transparent manner, and ensuring that the execution of these activities does not in any way compromise the security and effectiveness of protocol and node operator operations. \n\nCurrently the proposed implementation by Flashbots (MEV-Boost) seems to be the one most closely aligned with the ethos of the greater Ethereum community as evidenced by the parties which have joined the WG, such as leading node operators, staking pools, etc., as well as the Ethereum client teams\u2019 willingness to support changes in specs that MEV-boost would require to function properly. \n\nLido\u2019s participation in the WG will ensure that Lido has a voice in the design, testing, and possibly implementation of Flashbots, and it is important that this participation happens\n\n\n### For further context and information:\n\n* Forums proposal for joining the WG: https:\/\/research.lido.fi\/t\/join-the-flashbots-eth2-working-group\/1451\n\n* Flashbots medium post on WG announcement: https:\/\/medium.com\/flashbots\/announcing-the-flashbots-eth2-working-group-599b2b92634b\n\n* Ethresearch post on MEV-boost: https:\/\/ethresear.ch\/t\/mev-boost-merge-ready-flashbots-architecture\/11177\/ \n","protocol":"lido","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x32254b28F793CC18B3575C86c61fE3D7421cbbef","totalVotes":52,"blockNumber":13927138,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/lido-snapshot.eth\/proposal\/0x12d75092ac4eb3037e321b00a4fa165726aad8d03540fa1cd1305a5eb70f79aa","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641142800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1641574800}","startTimestamp":1641142800,"endTimestamp":1641574800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 85965170, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

This allows a user to specify which ranges they would like to supply capital rather then your standard zero to infinity curve. This increases capital efficiency & ROI and turned liquidity mining into a much more profitable venture then in v2. The main problem with this new mechanic is only the most dedicated power users will consistently see these new increased yields. The Solution?\n\nLixir.Finance\nLixir Protocol delivers optimal capital efficiency, minimum impermanent loss and solves the inactive liquidity problem in Uniswap v3 yield farming. Simply choose your desired token pairs, and Lixir optimizes and auto-balances your positions accordingly. Our application will be live next week. we are a utility platform designed to maxamize your returns through LP & incentivize users to participate with $LIX tokens. \n\nWe believe $lix will be the leader in this new category of automators & would like to be included in the Zentrest platform. Lixir investors can use it to go long or double up on positions as well as borrow other assets from Zentrest. This also would increase exposure to MantraDAO & the OM token.\n\nIf you would like to learn more please take a few moments and check out our website and medium articles.\n\nhttps:\/\/lixir.finance\/\nhttps:\/\/lixir-finance.medium.com\/\n","protocol":"mantraDao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x5b00F3D1644fF3106248B2C50505A67ABF31efFF","totalVotes":3,"blockNumber":12453611,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/mantra-dao\/proposal\/Qmcyp55WAcqLEHYe2wX1QT7ESGF6kS9A6wH9kE9ytziWK8","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1621267200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1621612800}","startTimestamp":1621267200,"endTimestamp":1621612800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, add LIX to Zenterest', 'No, do not add LIX to Zenterest']","results":"[{'total': 3633775000, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

The donut is on top of Randy\u2019s Donuts in Ingelwood, California.\n\n**Placement**: Fabricate & Place Nouns Glasses On Randy\u2019s Donut\n\n**Renderings**:\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/JUYEIIF.jpg)\n\n**Contributor Info**: My name is Josh and I own Plutus Media, a full service marketing agency based in NYC. In collaboration with a Los Angeles based business partner, WOW Media, I am proposing this unique outdoor placement for the Nouns! I am able to place media on Randy\u2019s Donuts, a landmark donut shop in Inglewood, CA. Maybe you\u2019ve seen it featured in Iron Man 2 when Tony Stark was eating a donut in the Iron Man suit on the donut.\n\n**Where**?: Randy\u2019s Donuts- 805 W Manchester Blvd, Inglewood, CA 90301\n\n**When**?: Based on time to go live, the placement is available the entire month of March. So any week within March can be reserved.\n\nMy goal for this is to present the Nouns with a unique and viral outdoor advertising opportunity worthy of the DAO and Nouns brand. Something that everyone will talk about, share, and appreciate.\n\nThis outdoor placement is in true Nouns style, and not the typical Times Square NFT placement. The donut is also illuminated when the sun is down, so the donut will always be visible since Randy\u2019s is open 24\/7. The placement can be live for up to 3 weeks.\n\nThis Nouns glasses placement involves fabricating an over 30 foot pair of Nouns glasses and placing them directly in front of Randy\u2019s Donut.

Astronauts will take a picture of the Noun, with various backgrounds such as the inside of the space station and the window looking out on the Earth.

Imagine simply visiting [ `https:\/\/nouns.center\/assets` ](https:\/\/nouns.center\/assets) and finding everything you need to work and create with Nouns.

I added some example categories below to help visualize this. We could break up question types be category and begin to collect dozens of questions & answers in each section.

My plan is to fetch this data and bring it into the site. Imagine, if someone has a question they could simply visit [https:\/\/nouns.center\/dev ](https:\/\/nouns.center\/) to find all these answers, and I would fetch the data on this new site because artist and non-devs could benefit as well. Those who don\u2019t have a Github account nor would ever go to the Developer channel on Discord could simply go to [https:\/\/nouns.center\/artist ](https:\/\/nouns.center\/) to find questions answered already about where to find assets, how to compose a Nouns, canvas dimensions etc.\n\nIt will snowball once the infrastructure is in place.\nQuestions will be asked once, and linked forever.\n\n# 2) Project Aggregator\n\nI\u2019ve aggregated every piece of Nouns content (so far) that I could find in [this spreadsheet. ](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1QlE93Uv4L3pTOPmrgLvr1NinPDB6atQ_ZbbU6vkHmXs\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIt\u2019s a lot.

We should have a one-stop-shop for that as well. It should be compelling visually and truly highlight the power of CC0 and our community.

The collection would use Nouns and their aesthetics as its leading design element. The 5-piece collection will contain 3D-printed textiles that would elegantly incorporate Nouns in their fabric.\n\nAs opposed to past collections in which I only used FDM (desktop printers) to make the entire collection, I am interested in incorporating more printing technologies to this collection. I want to test the boundaries of the latest printing tech, whether it be FDM, SLS, Polyjet etc. As with all my past work, the goal is to get the collection to be showcased in different tech conferences, fashion events, galleries, and museums.\n\nI am a 3D printing fashion pioneer and my fashion collections have been showcased in all the top traditional media outlets worldwide ([NYT, WSJ, Bloomberg, BBC, The Guardian, Forbes, Vogue, ELLE, etc 1](https:\/\/danitpeleg.com\/press\/)) countless events (including the Rio opening ceremony at Paralympics and Mercedez-Benz fashion week), [museums](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/2p8zbz79), documentaries, newspapers, books.

I [experimented with minting some of my pieces](https:\/\/rarible.com\/danitpeleg3d), bought different kinds of NFTs, and bonded with awesome artists (mainly female ones!). Ever since I heard about Nouns, I have been thinking about how I can bring my skills and know-how to contribute to Nouns' culture.\n\nI came up with a few concepts like nouns' merch etc' but then I realized:\n\nNouns can help me **push my creative and technical boundaries to bring the most innovative fashion collection to life**, and I can help **proliferate Nouns to new audiences!**\n\nWith Nouns' funding, I can spend the next few months working on what I love the most (making 3D-printed fashion, pushing the boundaries of the possible with the current technology). And with the result - a uniquely wearable Nounish 3D-printed fashion collection - Nouns and NounsDAO story can proliferate and get known with new audiences (like, more women, 3d printing enthusiasts, digital fashionistas, fashion students, and more!)\n\n**How will the collection proliferate Nouns?**\n\nI wanted to touch on this because it's the key question: how will people hear about this? how will this get attention?\n\nMy two last big collections, the 2015 [\"Liberty Leading the People\" 1](https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/yt6dj264) and the 2017 [\"Birth of Venus](https:\/\/danitpeleg.com\/the-birth-of-venus\/)\", both received incredible amounts of press coverage. Why? because they both had strong underlying stories. The Liberty collection was a \"first\" - it was the first 3D printed fashion collection printed entirely at home, and the Birth collection was based on the 3D printed dress I [made for the Paralympics](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xcvYRjWdfyU), and also it contained the first commercially available [3D printed jacket](https:\/\/danitpeleg.com\/product\/create-your-own-3d-printed-jacket\/).\n\n![danit-peleg-venus-1_(1)1800\u00d71008 183 KB](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/original\/1X\/4a4ddc3a75d3493d6859cb613d453922ff589842.jpeg)\n\n![WhatsApp_Image_2021-11-02_at_1.33.55_PM1600\u00d7857 219 KB](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/original\/1X\/11f4fea59fd76560d03d3fd969035d83e7ea6cfe.jpeg)\n\nThe Nouns + Innovative tech + Fashion angle will surely fascinate many. A good story will be crafted, and I am sure that this collection will get a lot of attention because it is touching on all the most fascinating topics of our times: cryptoculture, 3D printing, digital fashion, AR etc'\n\n**So, what are the phases required to produce a 3D-printed fashion collection?**\n\n1.  **Research** - Inspiration board, material research, printing samples\n2.  **Design** - sketches (and more sketches)\n3.  **Modeling** - 3D modeling the sketches into 3D-printable files (working with **zeeraffe)**\n4.  **Print testing** - testing many different types of printers, configurations, materials etc\n5.  **Printing finals** - printing the entire collection\n6.  **Assembling** - using different techniques (e.g. gluing, knotting, etc) to assemble the collection together\n7.  **Photoshoot** (with real-life models) - for press materials, websites, AR filter etc\n8.  **Runway show** - either invited to showcase at an event like nft.nyc, fashion weeks etc'\n9.  **Marketing** - prepare press kit, the collection get PR, is booked for events, and showcases galleries & museums\n\n**Budget & next steps**\n\nTo kickoff phases 1+2, I am asking **3.15 ETH** so I can commit to start the creative process, defining the technology I need to use as well as developing a detailed budget.\n\n**Deliverables for this first phase:**\n* Creating a full sketchbook of what I envision the collection will look like\n* A robust budget for phases 4-9 that can then be presented to the community for feedback.\n\nJust to give a sense of the sizing of this project to reduce uncertainty --- and it really all depends on the type of technologies we will use for printing (e.g. polyjet is MUCH more expensive than FDM) --- I estimate a full fashion collection can be done for **$80K-150K.**\n\n![https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/optimized\/1X\/9a898527788f6f81df411e5d32a0b5a10ab083dd_2_244x400.jpeg](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/optimized\/1X\/9a898527788f6f81df411e5d32a0b5a10ab083dd_2_244x400.jpeg)  ![https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/optimized\/1X\/d3a3cc6a176310931bd8351c6f3e191148302495_2_276x142.jpeg](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/optimized\/1X\/d3a3cc6a176310931bd8351c6f3e191148302495_2_276x142.jpeg) ![https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/optimized\/1X\/3e73dd086b1500552ad124d0bfd3629b0a719ec5_2_108x375.jpeg](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/optimized\/1X\/3e73dd086b1500552ad124d0bfd3629b0a719ec5_2_108x375.jpeg)\n\n*A 3D printed noun sample of textile idea and a sketch of one of the outfits*\n\n![https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/original\/1X\/7a10dea807982fcc6c42bdbdf2fa9028a53ebeb3.gif](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/original\/1X\/7a10dea807982fcc6c42bdbdf2fa9028a53ebeb3.gif)\n*A 3d-printed fabric I created in the past year, I would like to use this tech in this collection*\n\nFor this project, I will be collaborating with Zeeraffe, a 3D Modeller and Developer who created [Turn a Noun](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/turnanoun).\n\n\n*A bit more about me:*\nI\u2019m a 3D printed fashion designer.

These NFT's are claimable for Nouners plus all the tools will be public and sounds will be compeletely CC0 for the community to enjoy.\n\n## **How?**\n### Part 1 - The Noun Track Stack\nNouns have a stack of visual characteristics that make them unique, with Noun Tracks now they have their own sounds too!\n\nNoun Tracks contain a 1:1 sonic representation of every layer of a Noun. \n\nEach visible layer of the Noun corresponds to a unique component of the song:\n\n\n**Layer 1 - Backgrounds (2)** - Key, either Major or Minor.\n\n```\nKey_Background {\n    boolean major;\n} \n```\n\n**Layer 2 - Bodies (30)** - Chord Progressions containing unique Bass & Harmony patterns and samples. These correspond to the \"body\" of the song.\n\n```\nChordProgression_Bodies {\n\tPattern bass;\n\tPattern harmony;\n\tSample bassSample;\n    Sample harmonySample;\n}\t\n```\n\n**Layer 3 - Accessories (137)** - Drum Loops containing unique snare, hat, percussion and kick patterns and samples.

For example, Nouns with the shark head will have a shark chomp sound effect!\n\n```\nFX_Heads {\n    Sample lead;\t\n    Pattern fx;\n    Sample fxSample;\n} \n```\n\n**Layer 5 - Glasses (21 patterns)** - Lead Pattern, aka the musical notation of the Lead Sample produced by Nate.\n\n```\nLead_Glasses {\n\tPattern lead;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n### Part 2 - Construction of a Noun Track\nOnce an auction is settled and a new Noun appears a new Noun Track is created and minted! \n\nUsing a custom \"Noun Track Creation Contract\" Arpeggi will pull the correspoding Samples and Patterns from the current Nouns features to create each days Noun Track. \n\n**Example Noun Track**\n![](https:\/\/hackmd.io\/_uploads\/SJaT7N4OY.png)\n\n[![](https:\/\/hackmd.io\/_uploads\/ryOUougFt.png)](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/647873210)\n\n\n\n```\nNoun_Track {\n\tKey_Background key;\n    ChordProgression_Bodies chords;\n    DrumLoop_Accessory drums;\n    FX_Heads fx;\n    Lead_Glasses lead;\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Noun Tracks Samples**\n![](https:\/\/hackmd.io\/_uploads\/HJbJ4ENut.png)\n\n[![](https:\/\/hackmd.io\/_uploads\/SJyni_xFt.png)](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/647873573)\n\n\n![](https:\/\/hackmd.io\/_uploads\/rydSUNEOF.png)\n\n[![](https:\/\/hackmd.io\/_uploads\/Syc0odgKt.png)](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/647873417)\n\n\n(*please note that this was created using a BETA Version of Arpeggi Nouns where Percussion field was used or FX.  The final version will have greater flexibility)\n\n### Part 3 - Minting & Distribution \n\nEvery Noun has a corresponding Noun Track that can be claimed by the Noun owner. A Nouner simply connects the wallet to NounTracks.wtf and they can claim their corresponding Noun Track.\n\nIn addtion to the NFT being minted the Noun Track will be simultaneously uploaded w\/ it's Noun artwork to the traditional music DSP's and platforms. Using a platform such as Revelator's on-chain IP rights management system the royalties generated will be split between NounsDAO, the Nouner, and the creators at 33.3% each. \n\nDon't worry if you don't own a Noun.

{"refId":"cHJvcG9zYWw6bm91bnNkYW86ZGVmYXVsdDoyMw==","id":"23","title":"Nouns Proposal Auction House","content":"### What is it?\nNouns Proposal Auction House (or Prop House) is an experimental approach to deploying capital: an auction of ETH where the bids placed are proxy NounsDAO proposals. At the end of each auction, Noun owners (Nouners) vote on which proposal gets funded.\n\nThis proposal aims to be the MVP for a trustless on-chain solution.\n\n### Why?\nThe NounsDAO treasury is accruing capital at a $100M+ annual run rate. While NounsDAO has pushed several proposals through to execution, the current funding process does not seem like the optimal approach to scaling to thousands of projects. Prop House is an exploration of an alternative funding mechanism: forced treasury spend that minimizes friction to propose while maintaining quality via Nouns DAO member votes.\n\n#### Forced treasury spend\nIf the underlying thesis behind Nouns DAO is that the more a meme is spread, the more its provenance is worth, then spending the treasury to proliferate Nouns 1 makes a lot of sense. Assuming there is ongoing supply of ideas to proliferate Nouns, Prop House aims to force perpetual spend to capture this supply.\n\n#### Minimizing friction\nAnyone who wants to build on Nouns 2 is encouraged to do so. To this end, there is documentation and guidance to help builders get funded as quickly as possible. Still, proposing to the DAO involves friction. It means joining a new community, proposing an idea, getting sponsorship, achieving community consensus and more. The process can take a week or more before proposing on-chain which takes yet another week. Prop House could alleviate some of this friction by redirecting focus to the proposal itself instead of other functions.\n\n#### Quality\nAssuming that being able to amass the significant amount of capital required to buy a Noun is correlated to being a good capital allocator, NounsDAO members represent a pool of intellectual capital that could be used as a quality filter for the best use of the Prop House auction funds.\n\n### How would it work?\nFunds requested from the DAO would be sent to a 2\/3 safe controlled by cryptoseneca, devcarrot and Pixelz. The funds would be used to run three auctions of varying amounts and run times, for example:\n\n* 5 ETH with a 7 day proposal and 3 day voting period.\n* 10 ETH with a 14 day proposal and 3 day voting period.\n* 20 ETH with a 21 day proposal and 3 day voting period.\n\nThe differing amounts and run times are to test which scale (if any) is best suited for the format.\n\nA web app will be built as the home for the project where both auctions and voting will take place. Auctions will run for their allotted time, allowing anyone to bid with a proposal. The consecutive voting period will have Nouners vote for the proposal of their choice. At the end of the voting period, the funds will be transferred to the proposal with the most votes.\n\n### Funds Requested\nThis proposal requests a total of 36 ETH from the DAO:\n\n* 35 ETH to fund three auctions.\n* 1 ETH for operational spend\n\n### Who is behind this proposal?\nseneca, one of the Nouns project founders. I will be building Prop House alongside devcarrot (Nounder) and Pixelz (designer) with help from the rest of the Nounders.\n\n### Mock Up\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZRDauGe.png)\n\n\n### Other Considerations\nProp House aims to be the MVP of a trustless on-chain solution. If the experiment succeeds, the next logical step would be to build an unopinionated suite of contracts that automate the process.\n\nConceptually, the contracts could be the seed to a crypto native Y Combinator model.

We will also commission the artists behind the successful Gitcoin Moonshot Bot NFTs to make a series of 5 Moonshot Nouns, 1 of which will be auctioned over the course of the round with the proceeds going to Gitcoin general fund, and 4 of which will go to winners that the Nouns community selects from each GR12 category (Climate, Advocacy, Longevity, Ethereum), in a limited edition NFT crossover event.\n\n[Discourse Discussion for A Very Nounish Gitcoinmas](https:\/\/discourse.nouns.wtf\/t\/proposal-a-very-nounish-gitcoinmas-nft-crossover-event-169-eth-to-crypto-public-goods\/369)\n\n**What's Gitcoin?**\n\n* Gitcoin is a crypto-native public goods funding and open source jobs & coordination platform successfully built and spun out of Consensys into a DAO with its own ERC-20 ($GTC). [Gitcoin has raised $40 million for open source and public goods funding in its lifetime](https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/results).  One popular Gitcoin feature has been quarterly funding rounds for grants to public goods and open source projects that are accompanied with quadratic matching by sponsors.  That quadratic matching is designed to assess both the quantity and quality of support that a given project gets, creating an effective way of measuring dollar voting without descending into plutocracy.  These rounds, the energy and money they incubated for public goods, have been a great success for the Ethereum community in general.  Gitcoin has raised tens of millions of dollars through their GRs alone.\n* [Vitalik on Gitcoin](https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2019\/10\/24\/gitcoin.html) \n* [Gitcoin GR12](https:\/\/gitcoin.co\/blog\/announcing-grants-round-12\/)\n* [Vitalik on Quadratic payments](https:\/\/vitalik.ca\/general\/2019\/12\/07\/quadratic.html)\n* [Radical Markets, an overview of Radical Democracy tools like quadatic funding applied to solve economic and other problems](https:\/\/press.princeton.edu\/books\/hardcover\/9780691177502\/radical-markets)\n* [Lemonade Stand, A handy guide to financial support for open source](https:\/\/github.com\/nayafia\/lemonade-stand)\n\n**How does Nouns DAO benefit?**\n\n\n* **Fund the public goods from which we were created and on which are future depends.** Who's going to build the roads? We are.\n* **Signal to the Ethereum, crypto, open source, and builder communities that our ethos aligns with theirs.**  We will be the one of largest matching partners, if not the #1. [The Ethereum Foundation is giving $500k specifically for the Advocacy category](https:\/\/blog.ethereum.org\/2021\/11\/16\/advocacy-grants\/) for example.\n* **Make it normative for DAOs to support both crypto and real world public goods just as part of their DNA.**  Everyone benefits from this, it's a good seed for open source crypto and decentralized organizations, because we are and always will be all in this together.  We're leaders, let's lead.\n* **Marketing to the types of creators and builders we want to attract for Nouns proposal that we are open for business.** Gitcoin projects have huge overlap with the types of projects and creators we would consider funding. It's a large gm to them all.\n* **Demonstration that business should be sealed with NFT miscegenation and crossover events**. In this case, between Noun DAO's NFT and Gitcoin's.  Who knows what this type of NFT-rooted relationship could evolve into but there's memetic consistency in sealing a deal with an NFT crossover event.  Worst case, we have created more fun symbolically important art.  Best case it creates deeper ways to engage and collaborate with fellow DAOs or boomer organizations like Arby's.\n\n**Moonshot Nouns**\n* These will be 5 NFTs, made and managed on the Gitcoin side with input from the Nouns side.\n* Will feature both Moonshot Bot and Nounish elements in some fashion.  Obviously, the most distinctive Nounish element are our glasses but there's also the distinctive heads which could be of use.  Artist may make a themed one for each category (Climate, Advocacy, Longevity, Ethereum) and then one uber-one. \n* The uber-one NFT will be auctioned on the 1st or 2nd of the round with an auction set to end on the 2nd to last day of the Round (December 11th).  Auction will be promoted on both Nouns and Gitcoin side. Proceeds will go to Gitcoin general fund or multisig.\n* The category Moonshot Noun NFTs will be doled out to a champion from each category, determined by a process we run on the Nouns side.  Likely a small Nouns team will pick the top 10 projects in each category and then put it up for vote to the public. Potentially we can create a polling page on Nouns.wtf to drive engagement directly to our home rather than Twitter.  TBD.\n* This is all subject to change if a better NFT crossover path and strategy emerge in process or it become unworkable.\n\n * [Decrypt on Moonshot Bot launch](https:\/\/decrypt.co\/79606\/moonshot-bots-nfts-gitcoin-ethereum-grants-1-8-million)\n* [Moonshot Bots](https:\/\/bots.moonshotcollective.space\/)\n* [Moonshot Collective](https:\/\/moonshotcollective.space\/)\n\n\n![E9f3Y__VUAg47fL|690x349](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard21\/uploads\/nouns\/optimized\/1X\/9c6985a26194d4e43142051f595aa90d93c95f96_2_690x349.jpeg)\n\n**Steps and Timing**\n\n1.

Let\u2019s make it happen and find out!\n\nTo contribute to the elevation of Nouns to cultural icon status, broaden the scope and understanding of what the Nouns characters can be, and also to encourage contribution and interactivity in Nouns-art-making, we will create 4 short films centered around Nouns.\n\nWe will explore the creative potential of Nouns by making each film with totally different genres and techniques. From this we will learn what works, what doesn\u2019t, and inform what motion strategies we should explore next.\n\nThese short films will be the first of their kind, and hopefully will inspire other creators from the broader community to generate more motion projects featuring the Nouns.\n\nThis is just a first step to dip Nouns\u2019 toes in the water of motion storytelling and for us all to learn. We have grand ideas for how this first step can seed one or potentially many Nouns content projects, including but not limited to: creating even more elevated Nouns content, creating a platform for Nouns in motion (or Nouns art generally), an ongoing narrative series, curated anthologies from artists around the world, and community-contributed storytelling.\n\n**The Films**\nWe want to cover as many genres and techniques as possible to be able to experiment and learn from how Nouns translate into all these different outcomes. Ideally, no two films will cover the same ground. Let\u2019s explore...\n\n**Genres:** drama, comedy, experimental, family, action, adventure, romance, adventure, musical, thriller...\n\n**Medium \/ Technique:** Pixel art, traditional 2D animation, 3D animation, stop-motion, live action, puppetry, augmented reality...\n\nAward winning hybrid production company Pixel and web3 media collective StudioDAO will form the Nouns Stories team and collaborate to create all 4 films. Each film will have a different director but may share some production team members.\n\n**Distribution & Sale**\nWe are currently thinking about releasing one film per week for a month in 2022 (but are open to suggestions or ideas on this). It would be great to premiere them at noun'o'clock every monday for example The films will be made as accessible as possible and shared for free, potentially on many networks and platforms. We believe Nouns content should not be gatekept, our goal should be to reach the largest audience possible (and encourage others to do so).\n\nThe films themselves will be CC0 and everyone will be encouraged to use them however they wish. NounsStories team may decide that its a good idea to enter the films into festivals or other events or platforms around the world to increase both reach and gain prestige. The films shall always remain accessible online (and free) however, and we should not ever conform to any requests to pull them down in order to participate in an event (some film festivals may require this in order to screen at their events).\n\nThe films might also be minted as NFTs, ideally on a custom NounsStories contract, and auctioned off (and pending the level of success, perhaps assets, elements from the production, or offshoot artwork and content could be minted too). Ideally the royalites from these sales would go to the artists that are responsible for the film's creation.\n\n**Contributors & Compensation**\n* 7 ETH for the production of each film\n* 28 ETH total\n\n\n**Pixel**\n* Role: Nouns Stories Creative Direction team + Production Company on 3 films + Marketing and festivals\n* Compensation: 21 ETH\n* Wallet: 0x5184782cC00E90D2E0C82A8f22729f7f38a572B8\n* Handle: @goldypix (on behalf of Pixel)\n\n**StudioDAO**\n* Role: Nouns Stories Creative Direction team + Production Company on 1 films\n* Compensation: 7 ETH\n* Wallet: 0x09907f01d6192192f767deFB01C7Ee10cF82c24c\n* Handle: @studioDao\n\n**Project Timeline**\n\n* Development and Pre Production: 2 months\n* Production & Post Production: 2 months\n* Film Launch: 1 per week for 1 month\n\n\n**Meet the NounStories Team**\n**Pixel**\nAs a production company, Pixel has been creating award winning short form content for over a decade. We\u2019re a highly collaborative team of producers, writers, directors, designers, animators, and technicians, that specialises in all things hybrid and animation.\n\nFollowing the success of Goldy\u2019s acclaimed stop motion short film Lost and Found, we created the Original Content department at Pixel, with the sole focus on creating beautiful and meaningful narrative work, with a unique aesthetic that is intimately connected to the story we\u2019re telling.\n\n**Goldy**\nGoldy, is an Oscar\u00ae shortlisted, Annie nominated, Australian Academy, Directors Guild, and Webby award-winning director and co-owner of hybrid production company [Pixel](https:\/\/www.pixel.melbourne\/directors\/goldy\/). His heartfelt stop motion short film [Lost & Found](https:\/\/youtu.be\/35i4zTky9pI?t=16), has been viewed over 10 million times online, bringing tears to the eyes of a global audience.\n\nGoldy has been an active member of the Nouns community since its formation, with a compulsion for finding small ways to tell stories with Nouns, from Nouns movie trivia games, to poetry, comic strips, remixing imagery of daily Noun auctions, and his own art derivative project. Goldy is also a founding member of SharkDAO, an admin of the Shark discord, and is the current representative of SharkDAO on the Nouns server.\n\n**studiodao**\nStudiodao\u2019s mission is to develop a protocol that empowers creators to finance and control their own work, eliminating the restrictive features inherent in the standard practices of centralized media companies.\n\nstudiodao is redefining the role and popular notion of \u2018studio\u2019 and creating a new value proposition for creators and fans in entertainment and sports -- driven by the adoption of NFTs in 2021 and beyond.\n\n**kenbot a.k.a Kenny Miller**\nA creative and entrepreneurial leader, kenbot develops brands that target white spaces in digital media and the businesses that make them sustainable and disruptive.\n\nFrom the launch of Quicktime to video games, social networking, user-generated content, streaming media, dynamic ad models, and now NFTs, Kenny\u2019s focus has always been on engaging audiences. This path has led to iconic work for culture-defining brands such as Apple, Disney, Nickelodeon, Sesame Street, MTV, The Walking Dead, Netflix, and the New York Knicks. His work has connected deeply with users of all ages worldwide.\n\nKenny has been an active member of the Nouns community from rinkeby, is a founding member of SharkDAO, and the founder of studiodao.\n\n[Previous Discussion on Discourse](https:\/\/discourse.nouns.wtf\/t\/proposal-nouns-stories\/308)","protocol":"nounsdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E","totalVotes":13,"blockNumber":13679128,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13679128}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13698838}","startTimestamp":1637783076,"endTimestamp":1638053679,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR', 'ABSTAIN']","results":"[{'total': 47, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13698838}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1638053679}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13698838}, 'event': 'pending', 'timestamp': 1638043248}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13698838}, 'event': 'active', 'timestamp': 1638053665}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13698838}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1638053679}]"}

Provide Olympus 1.5% of Goddess DAO governance token for its assistance on the condition it is retained in the Olympus treasury.\n\nBackground\n\nFlow Carbon\/Goddess DAO aims to accelerate market adoption of tokenized carbon offsets, creating a liquid and transparent market. This market gives project proponents who create offsets access to instant liquidity, from the same pool that corporates can buy from at scale.\n\nWhat is GNT?\n\nGNT is a bundle token composed of individual ERC-20 tokens called GCO2. Each GCO2 is backed 1:1 with one metric ton of un-retired carbon credits. Different GCO2 tokens are specifically linked to a specific batch of credits issued for a specific project. Each individual GNT token represents one metric tonne of carbon certified as an offset, and meets the following criteria, which directly track what corporate buyers are seeking in the market:\nCertified by one of the market-recognized certification bodies, which currently are: Verra, American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, or Gold Standard\nCertified pursuant to a nature-based methodology from the above registries (i.e. REDD\/REDD+, ARR, IFM)\nVintage (issuance) year not more than five years old\n\nFor further background on GNT, Goddess DAO and Flow Carbon please see the forum discussion here https:\/\/forum.olympusdao.finance\/d\/994-oip-71-goddess-dao-launch-liquidity-assistance-proposal \n\nMotivation\n\nGoddess DAO aims to be a long-term values-aligned protocol with Olympus and see the value of and potential of OHM to achieve its vision. Flow Carbon previously conducted an otc swap of carbon credits (to create BCT) for OHM to Olympus, for the purpose of vesting its pKLIMA tokens. See: <https:\/\/forum.olympusdao.finance\/d\/187-oip-36-purchase-bct-in-the-otc-market-before-klima-launch ](https:\/\/forum.olympusdao.finance\/d\/187-oip-36-purchase-bct-in-the-otc-market-before-klima-launch)\nThe Flow team immediately staked the OHM from this sale and still holds it today. <https:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0x04f2694c8fcee23e8fd0dfea1d4f5bb8c352111f?a=0xab9952041329fda60288d17116b8cb959c920713 ](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0x04f2694c8fcee23e8fd0dfea1d4f5bb8c352111f?a=0xab9952041329fda60288d17116b8cb959c920713)\nHaving deep liquidity for the GNT token is essential for the launch - and Goddess DAO believes it would strengthen the launch for it to be paired with gOHM. Olympus is best placed to assist in this endeavor, and to show gratitude to the Ohmies, Flow is providing some of Goddess DAO\u2019s governance token supply to the Olympus treasury. Flow hopes for this to be the first step in a long relationship with Olympus that will be mutually beneficial.\n\nProposal\n\nOlympus to swap 80% of the BCT in its treasury for GNT to be held in the Olympus treasury and used to interact with Klima for the purpose of bonding or redeeming for KLIMA tokens\nOlympus provides $1.5mm in gOHM for initial liquidity of GNT as GNT-gOHM on Polygon - Goddess DAO will bond $1.5mm of gOHM (as an equal number of gOHM paired with the GNT) through Olympus Pro (OP) to Olympus and then Olympus will release the liquidity to Goddess DAO (Goddess DAO will not reduce or dispose of the gOHM within 24 months of launch without the consent of Olympus)\nGoddess DAO will provide $50K GDSS to Olympus to seed a liquidity pool of gOHM-GDSS and bond a further $50K in gOHM to Olympus through OP\nGoddess DAO will provide Olympus 1.5% of GDSS supply on the condition that it can\u2019t be disposed of without the consent of Goddess DAO\n\nPolling Period\n\nThis vote will be live for at least 72 hours.\n\nPoll question\n\nFor: Approve the launch liquidity assistance proposal\nAgainst: Do nothing\n","protocol":"olympusdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x131bd1A2827ccEb2945B2e3B91Ee1Bf736cCbf80","totalVotes":233,"blockNumber":14087820,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/olympusdao.eth\/proposal\/0x88b17056b2677673df2731eec8431a3aadcdc7f8f348e4b5fd06000363553e98","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643302800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643562000}","startTimestamp":1643302800,"endTimestamp":1643562000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[' Approve the launch liquidity as', 'Do nothing']","results":"[{'total': 84907.625, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1216.8455, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This proposal builds on OIP-47 -  Olympus Stopgap Budget Proposal - which specified the maximum monthly allocation by role but did not define the process for determining allocations or frequency of payments.\n\nThis proposal is the result of over two months of community discussions, including a DAO-wide sync on December 6, 2021.

OHM trades at a premium to its backing because the market understands that the treasury, revenue, liquidity, products, services and ecosystem integrations will continue to grow.\n\nIt\u2019s important to signal that backing per OHM will continue to increase, regardless of market trends.\n\nTo ensure backing is always able to increase, the DAO Policy team proposes to add inverse bonds to the treasury toolbox. Inverse bonds are exactly what they sound like: bonds, but inversed. The inverse bonds will be initialized if OHM trades below backing, defined as the market value of our treasury assets (not including the OHM side of LP), divided by the circulating supply of OHM. When initialized, users can send OHM to the treasury in exchange for an asset held by the treasury. Similar to how bonds work today, the discount for these bonds will change over time and the market decides acceptable discounts. Also like normal bonds, inverse bonds themselves don't impact market prices.\n\nIt bears specifically mentioning that this is not a static, \"direct redeem\" mechanism. Inverse bonds will remove sell pressure from the market, but in a way that will at the same time increase the backing per OHM. Inverse bonds increase the backing per OHM by reducing the amount of OHM in circulation, while paying out less than each OHM\u2019s backing.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Olympus smart contracts guarantee that 1 OHM is always backed by at least 1 USD in stablecoins. On top of that, Olympus pioneered protocol owned liquidity, where Olympus owns over 99% of all the OHM liquidity. This means that there will always be deep market liquidity for OHM.\n\nCurrently, the standard bonding process only increases backing per OHM when the treasury can sell bonds above backing price.\n\nInverse bonds add another mechanism that in certain market conditions will allow OHM holders to sell their OHM at a premium, without affecting the market price and while simultaneously increasing backing per OHM.\n\nBy introducing inverse bonds, Olympus is also able to maintain the bonding process throughout all market conditions.\n\nIllustrative Example:\n\nOHM price is at $100, Backing is at $120. You see that the inverse bond price has ticked up to a 5% premium. That means you will be able to sell your OHM at $105 to the treasury, instead of $100 to the market. The inverse bond price would not be able to exceed $120, because at that point it's a net drain on the treasury.\n\n\nProposal\n\nAuthorize the policy team to:\n- Create inverse bonds as a market lever\n- Launch inverse bonds if OHM begins to trade below its backing. Note that it is not a tool to peg OHM to that value. The lever brings OHM out of circulation and burns it, which increases the backing per OHM on every inverse bond executed.","protocol":"olympusdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x389b11C4fA4b95bCc252A2B20Bb62310Fbc36746","totalVotes":309,"blockNumber":14066008,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/olympusdao.eth\/proposal\/0xa544837835f3c4e681efba18d33623d4eb2acedec352dfc3c926a45902cd3612","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642957200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643130000}","startTimestamp":1642957200,"endTimestamp":1643130000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Authorize inverse bonds', 'Do not authorize inverse bonds']","results":"[{'total': 110632.836, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 138.54161, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

The treasury team implements the community\u2019s decisions through a number of tools, the effective use of which often requires both speed and technical knowledge.\n\nOn the one hand, it is critical that the community is broadly aligned on key decisions. On the other hand, we believe it would be a mistake to require constant community votes on more technical questions, particularly when these technical questions arise in implementing decisions the community has already made.\n\nFramework Proposal:\n\nWe propose adopting the table linked as a general framework to clarify when the treasury team should take action to implement community decisions, and when it must seek specific authorization.\n\nBecause it is difficult to predict in advance every technical treasury issue that may arise, the following list is not intended to be exhaustive.

We are building a protocol for leveraging fixed income assets, like OlympusDAO v2 bonds, and are excited by the design space possible with OHM\u2019s \u201cexorbitant privilege\u201d as a reserve-backed asset.\n\nYou can learn more about us through our Linktree and our recently published whitepaper.\n\nBackground\n\nSee the proposal section for more background information https:\/\/forum.olympusdao.finance\/d\/1001-oip-72-fiat-dao-x-olympus-partnership \n\nMotivation\n\nSee the proposal section for more motivation information https:\/\/forum.olympusdao.finance\/d\/1001-oip-72-fiat-dao-x-olympus-partnership \n\nRationale\n\nUnder these terms, FIAT DAO will be providing 1% of $FDT supply to Olympus DAO at a 50% discount to prevailing market prices. OlympusDAO would be entrusted with half this amount liquid from the commencement. The vesting schedule on the other half would be faster than that of seed contributors (two years) as well as that of initial core contributors (three years). FIAT DAO is further committed to providing development resources for two key integrations which are expanded upon in the \u201cDevelopment Commitments\u201d section.\nFIAT DAO will look to accumulate $gOHM in order to have a material say in OlympusDAO governance. FIAT-OHM bonds are our ultimate priority in the future for this partnership. \nProviding liquidity for $gOHM will also be considered a viable treasury strategy for the DAO.\nAdditional context around this offer should also be considered. To date, FIAT DAO has allocated 0.5% of its token supply to the OlympusDAO community via the Jubilee event that took place throughout November. Moreover, another 1.1% of token supply is being distributed via liquidity mining rewards to providers pairing FDT against wsOHM and gOHM on Sushiswap - not to mention the further 0.5% of supply set aside for Olympus Pro. OlympusDAO will have thus received, either directly or to its community, 3.1% of FDT supply under the terms of this proposal.\n\nProspective Partner Integrations\n\nFIAT DAO sees three primary integrations to be built with \nOlympusDAO:\nShort-Term: \u201cOHMptions\u201d\nMedium-Term: Olympus Treasury Bonds\nLong-Term: FIAT-OHM Bonds\nSee the proposal section for more information on the proposed intergrations https:\/\/forum.olympusdao.finance\/d\/1001-oip-72-fiat-dao-x-olympus-partnership \n\nProposal\n\nApprove the implementation and prioritization of minimal viable product for Ohmptions as described above and the exploration of the other areas of collaboration subject to further governance votes as required.\nApprove Treasury swap of OHM for 1% of $FDT supply at a 50% discount, with 0.5% of the FDT vested immediately to Olympus and 0.5% FDT to be vested to Olympus over 12 months.\nOlympus will provide 0.5% FDT supply worth of OHM vested immediately to Fiat DAO.\nBoth Olympus and Fiat DAO commit to retain the swapped tokens.\nA 7 day historical TWAP from the date of announcement of this proposal will be used for conducting the swap should this proposal be approved by community governance.\nPolling Period\nThe temperature check process begins now and will run for at least 24 hours.

On the Olympus side, it requires gOHM holders to approve the whitelisting of a specialist contract, called \u201cThecosomata.sol\u201d to borrow OHM as needed (an OHMDEBTOR), to add LP. Thecosomata.sol will self-impose a 50% LTV limit.\n\nMotivation\n\nREDACTED CARTEL needs to greatly increase it\u2019s POL to market cap ratio to offer cool defi products to it\u2019s holders, such as lending\/borrowing facilities, and grow its treasury. Currently the POL\/MCap ratio is hovering around 6%, which is a third of what we need it to be. \n\nWith our market cap rising to $550M just 3 weeks after our TBE, we feel our existing LP bonds, which increase POL by $3M aren\u2019t moving quickly enough. This is further exemplified by the majority of BTRFLY trade volume going through a competing ETH : BTRFLY pool on Uniswap V3. Assuming our market cap stayed the same while we waited for LP bonds to beef up POL, we would be in limbo for the next 3 weeks. 3 weeks in DeFi is like 3 months IRL. \n\nThus, we need a quicker solution. Zeus recommended we consider a feature available in Olympus\u2019s V2 Treasury - the incurDebt() function. This function enables us to borrow OHM on our sOHM collateral, provided we are whitelisted. Whilst there is an explicit debt limit configurable for each client of this facility - we are willing to voluntarily impose a 50% LTV limit as well.\n\nWe have roughly $19M of sOHM (67K sOHM) in our treasury (as of 8th January 2022), with a 50% TVL, we would be able to borrow $9.5M upfront to create $19M worth of liquidity. This amount would grow over time as we receive staking rewards on our sOHM. In addition, this could be supplemented by bonding OHM instead of LP, enabling us to grow LP at a minimum of the same rate - while capturing future upside on the asset we are bonding. This upside would enable us to borrow more in the future to create liquidity. \n\nProposal \n\nREDACTED CARTEL request that Thecosomata.sol, a special purpose contract being build to access Olympus DAO debt facility to create POL, is whitelisted for the \u201cOHMDEBTOR\u201d role. This would enable it to borrow OHM using sOHM as collateral.\n\nBorrowing Parameters :\n\nAn initial absolute borrowing limit of 100K OHM\n\nA self-imposed 50% LTV limit, within Thecosomata.sol that can only be increased in cooperation with Olympus DAO\n\nDaily Operation of Thecosomata (while REDACTED POL < 20% BTRFLY Mcap) :\n\nMint BTRFLY equivalent to 0.5% of current total supply\n\nBorrow matching amount of OHM\n\nMint OHM : BTRFLY Sushiswap LP\n\nTransfer LP back to treasury\n\nAlongside this :\n\nLP bonds will be turned off, whilst Thecosomata is active and POL < 20% MCap\n\nOHM bonds will be pushed as the primary bonds within REDACTED whilst POL < 20% Mcap\n\nOnce POL hits 20% of MCap, REDACTED will begin diversifying bonds\n\n\nPoll\n\nFor:  Whitelist Redacted\n\nAgainst: Take no Action","protocol":"olympusdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x131bd1A2827ccEb2945B2e3B91Ee1Bf736cCbf80","totalVotes":482,"blockNumber":13987234,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/olympusdao.eth\/proposal\/0x165e20faa40955ec5400e47e669ff230de605f3383b184d6c0249d2e80f7f899","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641970800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642316400}","startTimestamp":1641970800,"endTimestamp":1642316400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Whitelist Redacted', 'Take no action']","results":"[{'total': 150694.73, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 409.7069, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

One key treasury initiative is to use concentrated liquidity to enable deep liquidity in the Defi landscape - across protocols, side chains and layer 2 solutions. The concentrated liquidity project is now at a stage where it\u2019s possible to start migrating part of current Sushi and Uniswap v2 liquidity to concentrated liquidity positions on Uniswap v3. In line with the Olympus Policy Framework (OIP-22) and the updated Policy Framework (OIP-56), a community vote is needed to add new treasury assets and add liquidity positions on new platforms (such as Uniswap).\n\nMotivation\n\nThe overall aim of this proposal is to initialize and seed Uniswap v3 concentrated liquidity pools and set up tooling and processes for concentrated liquidity management at Olympus. Liquidity management is, and will continue to be, a big topic with many moving parts. To keep tempo high the liquidity team is proposing a stepwise approach where processes and ways of working are built with limited risk. Once these processes are in place and better tooling is developed, high level goals can be set and larger positions can be moved or added.\n\nThe aim of the first three points below is to initialize, seed and deploy capital to leverage concentrated liquidity positions on Uniswap v3.\n\nThe aim of the fourth point is to enable deep liquidity on Uniswap v3 by leveraging concentrated positions and treasury OHM. OHM can be used to provide matching liquidity depth above the range of any concentrated positions. This will ensure full range liquidity and allows for much higher capital efficiency in other liquidity positions.\n\nProposal\n\n1. Migration of OHM-FRAX according to OIP-26\n\nThe migration of OHM-FRAX liquidity from Uniswap v2 to Uniswap v3 was already proposed and accepted in OIP-26. This is just a confirmation that tooling and internal processes have been developed and a stepwise migration will now be done.\n\nActions:\n\nCreation of Uniswap v3 OHM-FRAX pools and initiate stepwise migration of current Uniswap v2 liquidity.\n2. OHM liquidity on Uniswap\n\nAs a first step towards deep Uniswap V3 liquidity pools on Ethereum, we propose that two Uniswap v3 pools, OHM-DAI and OHM-ETH, be set up and seeded after OHM-FRAX. This ensures the new pools are ready, balanced and provides us with an opportunity to study potential trade volume, routing, arbitrage and ability to capture trading fees on Uniswap. The proposal seeks permission to move up to $10M of liquidity from each Sushi pair to Uniswap v3.\n\nTo capture the full potential of deep liquidity and trading routes on one platform, permission is also asked to whitelist all current liquidity pools on Uniswap and to move liquidity between Sushi and Uniswap as the need arises.\n\n$10M in the OHM-DAI pool is 2.8% of the Sushi liquidity for the pair. $10M in the OHM-ETH pool is 8.2% of the Sushi liquidity as of December 10, 2021.\n\nActions:\n\nPermission to move OHM pools between Sushi and Uniswap as the need arises\n\nCreate OHM-ETH and OHM-DAI pools and vaults on Uniswap v3\n\nMigrate up to $10M from OHM-DAI on Sushi to OHM-DAI on Uniswap v3\n\nMigrate up to $10M from OHM-ETH on Sushi to OHM-ETH on Uniswap v3\n\n**\n3. Enable and seed L2 liquidity on Uniswap**\n\nProteus\u2019s (OIP-45) goal is to seed gOHM liquidity across chains and L2\u2019s using mining incentives. This action point aims to prepare Olympus to deploy deep liquidity on supported L2\u2019s by leveraging concentrated liquidity on Uniswap v3. However, cross chain OHM is not launched yet and the utility of OHM on L2 is small at the moment. For example, both Arbitrum and Optimism have low activity compared to Ethereum L1. Therefore, only a limited amount of up to $1M in each target pool will be migrated. $1M is 0.28% of the current OHM-DAI Sushi liquidity and 0.82% of the current Sushi OHM-ETH liquidity.\n\nActions:\n\nCreate Uniswap v3 pools for OHM-DAI and OHM-ETH on Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nMigrate up to $1M from OHM-DAI on Sushi to OHM-DAI on Uniswap v3 on both Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nMigrate up to $1M from OHM-ETH on Sushi to OHM-ETH on Uniswap v3 on both Arbitrum and Optimism\n\n4. Permission to deploy OHM for liquidity provision use\nTreasury and\/or DAO OHM can be used to provide single-sided liquidity above the current market price in Uniswap v3 pools. By earmarking OHM for liquidity provision use, the Olympus treasury team gets a clearer long term view of OHM needs and the liquidity team can develop processes and gradually deploy OHM to match the new Uniswap v3 positions described above.\n\nThe earmarked OHM is calculated to enable a duplication of the present Sushi liquidity depth for OHM-DAI and OHM-ETH on Uniswap v3. At current prices, 250k OHM is needed. Future liquidity migration from Sushi will be combined with LP bonds to ensure that liquidity is not fragmented and at least the current depth is maintained.\n\nActions:\n\nPermission to deploy up to 250k OHM for liquidity provision use in OHM-DAI and OHM-ETH pools on Uniswap L1, Uniswap Arbitrum and Uniswap Optimism.","protocol":"olympusdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x131bd1A2827ccEb2945B2e3B91Ee1Bf736cCbf80","totalVotes":790,"blockNumber":13889448,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/olympusdao.eth\/proposal\/0x146db4ab5b1b126b5a5f61dc2bc387b14275bb561cf16094d8868518ec7b1d41","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640638800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1641243600}","startTimestamp":1640638800,"endTimestamp":1641243600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For ', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 286291.06, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 233.89159, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Where Olympus seeks risk-free value to back its treasury, Umami Finance takes a market-making approach to its treasury strategy, in addition to supporting protocols and infrastructure that do not currently exist on Arbitrum.\n\nArbitrum is an Optimistic rollup built on the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. It has attracted more than $2.5 billion in TVL in a short few months since launch. The Arbitrum network is poised to see a dramatic uptick in TVL and usage as it rolls out its planned Nitro upgrade, which will lower its gas fees even further and position it as a leader among L2 scaling networks for Ethereum.\n\nYou can read more about Arbitrum here.\n\nBy bonding gOHM and gOHM-paired LPs, Umami is well positioned to lock gOHM liquidity brought to Arbitrum, ensuring deep and lasting OHM liquidity on the network. Umami can also accelerate migration of gOHM liquidity to Arbitrum through its bond issuances and its partnerships with interoperability protocols.\n\nWhat Umami Needs From OHMies\nThe faster OlympusDAO can help Umami scale cross-liquidity between UMAMI and gOHM, the faster the Umami team can help establish gOHM liquidity on Arbitrum. The first step for an OlympusDAO and Umami Finance partnership would involve establishing a large UMAMI-gOHM trading pool on an Arbitrum exchange.\n\nUmami will take $1 million equivalent of UMAMI tokens from its treasury and provide that to the OHM treasury. In turn, OHM would need to devote $1 million equivalent in gOHM to pair with the UMAMI to build an UMAMI-gOHM LP on Arbitrum.\n\nUmami\u2019s Value Add\nUmami is preparing to offer a variety of gOHM-paired LP bonds that it will utilize to support OHM\u2019s growth on Arbitrum.\n\nUmami will commit to keeping >25% of its treasury composed of gOHM and gOHM pairs. It will build liquidity pairs to support gOHM trading liquidity across multiple assets, including gOHM-ETH.\n\nUmami will provide $1 million in UMAMI tokens to OlympusDAO for it to use to build a gOHM-UMAMI trading pool on SushiSwap. The OlympusDAO treasury will hold the SLP tokens from this pool, giving it upside from exchange fees and UMAMI token appreciation.\n\nUmami will swap its current primary UMAMI-MIM LP for UMAMI-gOHM once gOHM-ETH has $20M in liquidity on Arbitrum. The MIM in the UMAMI-MIM LP at the time of writing is worth approximately $1.5M. To assist in reaching that target, Umami will adjust its BCVs to make gOHM-ETH its second highest bonding priority after the UMAMI token LP itself. Umami will achieve this swap by market buying gOHM using the route MIM \u2192 ETH on Arbitrum and then executing an OTC ETH \u2192 gOHM swap with OlympusDAO.\n\nThrough its relationship with Arbi\u2019s Finance, Umami is developing and launching other DeFi protocols on Arbitrum to generate new use cases for gOHM on the network and help attract more liquidity to Arbitrum. When Umami rolls out its collateralized lending protocol by January, it will position gOHM as the protocol\u2019s primary collateral asset.\n\nVote:\n\nFor: Engage in partnership with Umami Finance\nAgainst: Don't do anything","protocol":"olympusdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x131bd1A2827ccEb2945B2e3B91Ee1Bf736cCbf80","totalVotes":726,"blockNumber":13889337,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/olympusdao.eth\/proposal\/0x1c0bf4f16fb811bc6de7e52b32a0a8397b966b6757d5cf170d3c7198dab340bb","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640638800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1641243600}","startTimestamp":1640638800,"endTimestamp":1641243600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For Umami Partnership', \"Don't do anything\"]","results":"[{'total': 251803.38, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2348.7937, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

The initial liquidity of this pool will be about $1.5M. If our latest proposal passes the stable coin will be MAI otherwise it will be DAI. Beethoven X is an official fork of balancer on Fantom, which focuses on trading efficiency, unique investment pools, and ecosystem collaborations.\n\nWe want to add more gOHM to our treasury by adding gOHM bonds and to do so bonders need to have easy access to gOHM so they can bond without having to bring the funds from another chain. Seeding a Beethoven X pool will give us the necessary liquidity to start the bonding process and we will keep adding liquidity to this pool as this will be our main liquidity pool. The trading fees will also bring a revenue stream to Exodia.\n\nAdding gOHM liquidity and gOHM bonds will help bring us closer to the Olympus community that has helped create us. This also helps us grow hand in hand with OHM and create a more symbiotic ecosystem among the large OHMie community, of which Exodia is a piece of. We will also move a majority of the liquidity from SpookySwap to Beethoven to take full advantage of this switch, the remaining liquidity on SpookySwap will simply be to help communicate price action between the Beets pool and Coinmarketcap, Coingecko or people using those APIs. We expected to reduce the liquidity to roughly $20k.\n\nThe current liquidity available for gOHM on Fantom creates unreasonable slippage to buy from the market which would decrease the liquidity we can offer to Olympus. By doing the trade OTC we can get the maximum amount of gOHM which can go towards the liquidity.\n\n\nVote: \nFor:  Sell 300k DAI worth of gOHM in order to seed the EXODIA BEETS liquidity Pool on Fantom.\nAgainst: Don't do anything","protocol":"olympusdao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x131bd1A2827ccEb2945B2e3B91Ee1Bf736cCbf80","totalVotes":599,"blockNumber":13889317,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/olympusdao.eth\/proposal\/0xaf7e69b44c0534696416f65522bcb16c4d711592db049c5b4e385ec9ba8c7a3f","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640638800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1641243600}","startTimestamp":1640638800,"endTimestamp":1641243600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 225502.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 4175.4893, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This will involve a payment of about 20m BZRX, or less than half of the liquid BZRX in the treasury directly to victims (no selling of BZRX). To be clear, this will also include setting up a new swap contract on BSC\/Polygon so that the people who did not swap their BGOV\/PGOV for BZRX before the attack, are now able to do so, including those who are PGOV\/BGOV LPs (since the BZRX bridged to BSC\/Polygon for this purpose has now been stolen).\n\n 2) The development team\u2019s personal losses of BZRX will also be compensated in full, but they will be paid in vBZRX (not BZRX) which will vest slowly until July 2024. This is done partly to maintain liquid BZRX funds in the treasury for the operation of the protocol and not empty the treasury and also as a gesture to the community and other victims of the attack who are having to accept a debt token and cannot be paid back immediately.\n\n 3) All other losses resulting from the attack (in all other tokens) will be compensated by issuing a debt token at a 25% premium to be repaid over time by the protocol from 30% of protocol revenue and fees (so protocol revenue breakdown will be 50% to Ooki\/BZRX holders, 30% to debt token and 20% to treasury). This approach has some similarities to what Pickle Finance and Indexed Finance did after their hacks, although there are differences.\nIn effect, the bZx DAO is making a commitment to repay the remaining losses over time, similar to a loan with a 25% premium.\nSpecifically, a tradable debt token will be issued with an initial face value of $1, and it will be given to victims in a 1.25:1 ratio to their losses. So for example, someone who lost $10,000 in the attack will receive 12,500 debt tokens nominally worth $12,500 when fully repaid (although the actual market value will vary and initially be much lower than that).\nThe DAO commits to using 30% of protocol fees earned on all 3 current deployments (BSC, Polygon, Ethereum), as well as all future deployments (unknown at this stage, but possibly Optimism, Arbitrum, AVAX, etc) to market buy the debt tokens at least once every month (possibly more) up to a token price of $1 (the face value of the token) until all the tokens are purchased and the losses from the attack are repaid in full (with premium). The once-a-month and 30% figure is a minimum - the DAO may choose to buy back more of the debt token at its discretion.\nAll attack victims who hold the debt tokens till the buyback is completed will therefore receive 125% of their losses in compensation in return for waiting. Victims can of course choose to sell or trade their debt tokens at any time, but the initial liquidity pool will be seeded at a price far below $1 in order to discourage the first claimants of the debt token from dumping their tokens into the liquidity pool in the first minutes and hours and making a profit at the expense of those who are slower to claim their tokens. Instead, the market price of the token will rise naturally over time as the debt token is bought back by the DAO and reward long-term holders.\n\n 4) Any assets recovered from the attacker (unknown at this time, although there is speculation that some of the USDT may be recoverable) will be given directly back to the victims who lost that particular token. So for example, if 50% of USDT is recovered, then it will be shared among all victims who lost USDT in proportion to their losses, and their allotment of the debt token accordingly reduced. However, this only applies until the debt token is issued and claimed. Once the debt token is issued, all recoveries will be used to market buy the debt token and benefit all victims equally. This is done to prevent double-dipping by victims of the recovered currency - you cannot get debt tokens for all your losses AND get a share of the recovered assets.\n\nForum Discussion Post: https:\/\/forum.bzx.network\/t\/consolidated-compensation-proposal-for-victims-of-5-nov-2021-bzx-attack\/573","protocol":"ooki","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x3e7fb3F9E9cd3649593c7e5fBe2A18C0C0179a36","totalVotes":18,"blockNumber":13640822,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/bzx.eth\/proposal\/0x1c09762c97dcd04287cafde35b23d5421f88054b636245e4a0f909843990eea4","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637262000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637521200}","startTimestamp":1637262000,"endTimestamp":1637521200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Agree', 'Disagree']","results":"[{'total': 2957169.5, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

However, this still represents less than 15% of the total token supply. \n\nOne potential issue is that regular Uniswap LP fees may not be enough to offset impermanent loss from occasional large changes in the PASTA\/ETH price ratio. Adding predictable, long term incentives should help counterbalance this effect and support greater participation.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI propose initiating a new liquidity incentive program, distributing 300,000 PASTA tokens to the Uniswap v2 PASTA\/ETH LP over 3 months.

So this proposed 300,000 expense would represent roughly 30% of the multisig's remaining funding over the next 3 months. During this time, additional fees from PASTA transfers or sales should partly offset this expenditure.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIf this proposal is approved by voters, the multisig will fund a liquidity incentive distribution mechanism with 300,000 PASTA from the treasury for a 3 month distribution period.

These incentives have so far been split as 0.20 PICKLEs\/block on mainnet, and 0.10 PICKLEs\/block on Polygon.\n\nThe proposal authorised the Pickle multi-sig in coordination with the core team to distribute PICKLEs across Ethereum and Polygon farms as it saw fit in consultation and transparent communication with the community. Now, as the possibility of OEC farms draws closer, the stewards of the PICKLE emissions distribution look again to the community for guidance on how to split the PICKLE pie.\n\n## Proposals\n\nThe following options are being given for the community to rank.\n\n### Proposal A\n\nFor those who believe the main attraction is still mainnet, where 80% of our TVL currently resides, and where 90% of DeFi TVL is still based. The following split is suggested:\n\n- Ethereum mainnet: 0.20 PICKLE\/block\n- Polygon: 0.05 PICKLE\/block\n- OKExChain: 0.05 PICKLE\/block\n\n### Proposal B\n\nFor those who believe that most opportunities lay at the frontiers, where most users who haven't tasted the benefits of Pickle and yield maximising are. The following split is suggested:\n\n- Ethereum mainnet: 0.15 PICKLE\/block\n- Polygon: 0.075 PICKLE\/block\n- OKExChain: 0.075 PICKLE\/block\n\n### Proposal C\n\nFor those who are excited about the new opportunities but have a bias towards the environments with the most traction. The following split is suggested:\n- Ethereum mainnet: 0.175 PICKLE\/block\n- Polygon: 0.075 PICKLE\/block\n- OKExChain: 0.05 PICKLE\/block\n\n## Vote\n\nAs this proposal is non-binary, we are using Snapshot's \"ranked choice voting\" or \"instant runoff voting\" algorithm to count the votes. This is a form of preferential voting, which helps reduce tactical voting or \"wasted votes\" by allowing voters to indicate what to do with their votes should their first-choices not win outright.\n\nAccording to the Snapshot docs, it works as follows:\n\n> Each voter may rank any number of choices. Votes are initially counted for each voter's top choice. If a candidate has more than half of the vote based on first-choices, that choice wins. If not, then the choice with the fewest votes is eliminated. The voters who selected the defeated choice as a first choice then have their votes added to the totals of their next choice. This process continues until a choice has more than half of the votes. When the field is reduced to two, it has become an \"instant runoff\" that allows a comparison of the top two choice head-to-head.\n\nAnd this is a diagram from Wikipedia:\n\n![IRV counting flowchart](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/b\/b9\/IRV_counting_flowchart.svg\/1920px-IRV_counting_flowchart.svg.png)\n\nThe voting power is still DILL i.e. 1 DILL equals 1 vote. \n\nIf \"Do Nothing\" wins, there will be no emissions directed to OEC.","protocol":"pickle","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x5c4D8CEE7dE74E31cE69E76276d862180545c307","totalVotes":50,"blockNumber":13099414,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/pickle.eth\/proposal\/QmfKzLvYTQ8f4swKLbjyN9wTAJxe8hx8Q1XCw9bp7gE7L1","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1629961200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1630134000}","startTimestamp":1629961200,"endTimestamp":1630134000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Proposal A', 'Proposal B', 'Proposal C', 'Do Nothing']","results":"[{'total': 81282.97, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1368.9868, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 6650.135, 'choice': 2}, {'total': 111687.6, 'choice': 3}]","events":"[]"}

In the past few months, Fennec has been involved in the following efforts:\n- creating unique art and NFTs for Pickle promotions including major jar launches, collaborations, and special occasions.\n- creating visual collateral for announcements, tweets, and articles.\n- creating illustrations, icons, and decorative elements for our rebranded UI. \n\nMost of these can be appreciated at the [Pickled NFTs](https:\/\/opensea.io\/collection\/pickles) collection in OpenSea.\n\nMoreover, Fennec has been actively involved as a community member at Pickle, sharing his thoughts on digital art, NFTs, and design as well as engaging in support, encouragement, and promotion of Pickle and its products. In his public interactions as well as his creations, Fennec has shown a highly positive spirit and a truly green heart in inspiring amounts, making for great atmosphere in all community channels where he has participated.\n\nFennec was originally engaged as a contractor, and as our briefs to him got more frequent, he kindly agreed to a modest retainer fee which was paid out of marketing and promotional expenses. As is common with many artistic engagements in the NFT world, Fennec and Pickle also agreed to split the proceeds of the sale of Pickled NFTs with Pickle receiving the initial lump-sum payment for each NFT sold while Fennec receives a 10% royalty on each subsequent re-sale. This agreement, originally intended as a 3-month trial, has been ongoing for over 6 months.\n\n**This is a draft proposal to formalise the role of Fennec as a core team member.**\n\n## Proposal\n\nIf submitted to a vote and passed, this proposal will give an additional, special mandate to the recently established \u201cSelect Committee on Continuing Operations and Compensation\u201d (approved in [PIP-39](https:\/\/signal.pickle.finance\/#\/pickle.eth\/proposal\/QmaAVGJtNuDHMrbWu5B4bNfiGvi9bV3i4uHuACXu17wn3L)) to review the current agreement between Pickle and Fennec, and approve a compensation package for Fennec that is commensurate with his expected contributions to the protocol going forward and is market-based and appropriate for our industry in general and protocol more specifically.\n\nFennec is now a well-regarded NFT artist, highly productive, and also dabbles effectively in other areas of graphic artistry and even UI design. I admit unremorsefully to relying on Fennec's NFTs to close collaboration partnerships \u2013 a very effective hook. This is only expected to increase in frequency as Pickle expands its marketing and business developments efforts going forward.\n\nFinally, it is important for our core team to have predictability in its talent resources. Fennec would not lack for opportunities if either party were to discontinue the existing engagement. However, it is the team's opinion that letting this happen would be to our protocol's detriment.\n\n## Addendum\n\nThe Select Committee on Continuing Operations and Compensation has a condition that Larry the Cucumber may not vote on any salary, bonus, or any other compensation to be paid to Larry the Cucumber. This condition shall be extended and construed such that members of the Committee may not vote on any salary, bonus, or any other compensation to be paid to their own selves.\n","protocol":"pickle","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x5c4D8CEE7dE74E31cE69E76276d862180545c307","totalVotes":69,"blockNumber":13080897,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/pickle.eth\/proposal\/QmQ6Zze6cNWCXBWD7U7casnJrKZBr5H9QgXnp1Dd1Mgmyg","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1629716400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1629889200}","startTimestamp":1629716400,"endTimestamp":1629889200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Proceed with Proposal', 'Do Nothing']","results":"[{'total': 159367.89, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 198.23514, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

I was first a lawyer in tax \/ corporate law. After that I studied finance before becoming a wealth manager. I've been a crypto \u201cearly\u201d investor since 2017. The last 4 yeasr I have created a Family Office in \u201ctraditional\u201d finance, participated in creating and managing an IT company and am currently building a third entity specialized in digitals assets investment in Switzerland. My employees and associates say I\u2019m attentive to others' positions and fair in my decisions. Integrity, fairness, and transparency are my motto in life. Pickle is my main investment in Crypto nowadays, and also the best community I have ever been part of. That\u2019s why I will do my utmost to make it grow well into the future. When Pickle brothers are calling to arms, we can\u2019t ignore the warcry!\n\n### Clintos#9235\n- Hi all! I\u2019m a multi- business founder, Director on a couple of boards, VC\/Angel Investor and DeFi Degen since DeFi Degens existed.  My companies have grown from a starting payroll of 4 to over 600 staff, including over 40 software\/web developers.  Was early enough in Pickle when it was about stablecoin pegs and had to migrate and rescue funds manually in Etherscan.  Lost 20k in the pDai hack and more than that in subsequent dump and IL in suicide pool.  But despite that, believe this community is the best in DeFi, big brains, big hearts and great frens and Pickle remains one of my largest homes to keep crypto capital.  I\u2019m always looking for opportunities for the protocol and look forward to helping Pickle hit its stretch goal this year. Thank you all for making this DAO what it is.\n\n### bwar#8815\n- Hi. I'm Bwar. I write code for a living, but not this kind of code. I've never hired anyone and have no experience in management or hiring. But I am not ignorant of typical wages in software development. I've re-organized several weekly meetings in my day job with more efficient agendas, tend to keep people on topic while still respecting the need for people more knowledgable than myself to take the lead when we dive into the details, and have been told I'm pretty good at it. I have a strong love for the protocol, have made code changes in two of the Repos, and rewrote the docs (they're Live, by the way, thanks @Sevenz!). My main goal is to ensure the committee gets all the information they need to make a decision, with as little interruption to the devs' business as is reasonably possible.\n\n### Merpenduous#6044\n- Hi all!  I work for a giant tech company as a middle manager in a semi-technical group.  I have under 20 people that report to me currently.  The size of my company is such that I don't engage on the payroll\/hr side of things, but have a massive wealth of templates from which to draw. I've flipped some of our job descriptions to match Pickle, and could get a sense for software developer salary at any level in virtually any country.  I'm all-in on Pickle, like crazy all-in; when I was nearing liquidation I kept Pickle and let my Chainlink go.  I tend to think outside the box A LOT, mostly because I'm not certain where the box is.  My oldest son's nickname was Pickle a decade ago (which drew me to Pickle in the first place), and I have a Larry the Cucumber t-shirt!\n\n### Cipio#4528\n- Hey Everyone! I have been investing in crypto since summer of 2017. I am a software engineer and integrator for real time systems. I do not have a lot of experience with management or payroll, but I do working with extremely talented engineers. I am also a huge fan of Pickle and will do whatever it takes to make sure the protocol is successful. I believe in a strong compensation package which would include a solid base pay, and a bonus structure that scales based on the individuals performance and how successful the team is at hitting specific financial goals. Honestly all the people up for election are amazing. Any subset of the people running will do a phenomenal job! Make sure to vote! Let\u2019s go Pickle!\n\n### Wunderbernd#3514\n- Hello, I am Wunderbernd and I study Business Informatics, so I have a little bit of knowledge in Computer Science, Digitalisation and Economics. I am in crypto since the summer last year, I mainly invested in stocks and traditional investment products before, but the more I learned about the crypto space, the more passionate I became and I increased my exposure. Pickle is one of my biggest positions, because it fits the traditional investment approach (low p\/e ratio, growth, disrupting industry etc.). I lack the experience of the others, but my passion for crypto and the space might exceed theirs. In the crypto space you don't have to know all the things, you need to put in the work. My main goal is to bring this protocol forward and work out a compensation structure that is fair and competitive, but also incentivizes good and hard work for the protocol.\n\n## Voting Method\n\nFor this by-election, we will be using the **approval voting** method. On the relevant snapshot, each DILL holder can give as many approvals as there are options to choose from (i.e. 6 in this case).

Pickle Partisan Proposes Panel to Prevent Protocol Paralysis","content":"author: **@bwar**\n\n---\n\n## Abstract\n\nThree team members contracts will expire imminently. Other reviews required in the coming months. A committee needs to be appointed to review and extend their contracts. The committee may also standardize compensation packages. \n\n### About myself\n\nI\u2019m a Dill member, have an interest in DeFi, and aped my money into this protocol and don\u2019t want it to die.\n\n## Background\n\nIt\u2019s my understanding that several paid team members have their contracts expiring in less than a week (4 days?). These members include LeeKuanJew, Chimaera, and 0xAnon. In addition to these three, I believe Brine-Master Larry\u2019s PICKLE grants, which vested over a six month period and were expected to be reviewed six months later, will expire next month as well.\n\nThe DAO has not approved, nor even been requested to look at, a proposal for budget to extend these contracts. The team seems to be super busy developing new jars, expanding partnerships, and continuing the business of Pickle.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, there\u2019s a clear conflict of interests in the Dev team proposing their own salaries in a PIP for the DAO to rubber-stamp. Our DAO has an absurdly high acceptance rate on proposals, at one hundred percent. The Devs could propose almost any number and surely find the votes somewhere to approve the salaries.\n\nPrevious salary negotiations were run by committees of protocol-friendly actors, which is a good thing in general. However, many of those members of previous committees have not remained active in the protocol. Even worse, several of those committee members are the very people up for review and cannot realistically vote on the salary or compensation of their team members or their boss.\n\n### Previous committee members\n\nPIP-31 (Larry\u2019s compensation) was \u201cput together with the help of the Pickle team and the assistance of multi-sig member Mah_Dills\u201d\n\nPIP-34 (Expand Core Team Budget) was run by: \u201cA hiring committee consisting of the Pickle core team (Larry_Cucumber, 0xkoffee, unlocker, purplezky, leekuanjew, chimaera, anoniminis), independent multi-sig members (jintao, Mah_Dills), and Brinery members (Rooster_Cogburn77, sifu, yyctrader)\u201d\n\n## Proposal\n\nI hereby propose a \u201cSelect Committee on Continuing Operations and Compensation\u201d be appointed in the following manner:\n\n-    (1) Larry the Cucumber, as grand maestro of this operation with an undeniable track record, shall be a member. He shall also be the presiding officer unless the Committee decides otherwise.\n-    (2) Jintao, a past committee member and multi-sig signer who is on retainer for our critical infrastructure but is not a salaried worker, shall be a member for his experience with both development and compensation in DeFi\n -   (3, 4) Two members to be appointed by Larry the Cucumber, so long as they are not a subject of the current review, at least one of which must have experience with hiring and compensation in DeFi\n -   (5, 6, 7) Three DillDao members to be be selected by a Discord vote of the DillDao, which shall last at least 30 hours for the nominating process and 30 additional hours for voting. The beginning and ends of both the nominating process and the election shall be posted in #Announcements and #DillDao to allow for the broadest possible participation. \n\nThe Mandate of the Committee shall be first and foremost to guarantee, to the best of the committee\u2019s ability, the continuing operations of the protocol by quickly and efficiently analyzing the current contracts and all other submitted information, and then proposing a compensation plan specific to those requiring extensions to their contracts.\n\nThe Secondary Mandate of the Committee, once the first Mandate has been accomplished, will be to standardize the compensation plans for our protocol more generally, to better ensure tiers, titles, and salary bands, and hiring and firing processes, that are appropriate for the industry and our protocol more specifically.\n\n### Conditions\n\n -   Larry the Cucumber may not vote on any salary, bonus, or other compensation to be paid to Larry the Cucumber.\n\nI further propose we immediately extend, for one month, the contracts of LeeKuanJew, Chimaera, and 0xAnon, in order to allow for continuity while the committee does its work.","protocol":"pickle","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x5c4D8CEE7dE74E31cE69E76276d862180545c307","totalVotes":61,"blockNumber":12835882,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/pickle.eth\/proposal\/QmaAVGJtNuDHMrbWu5B4bNfiGvi9bV3i4uHuACXu17wn3L","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1626411600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1626584400}","startTimestamp":1626411600,"endTimestamp":1626584400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Proceed with Proposal', 'Do Nothing']","results":"[{'total': 134077, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1200.4653, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Under the terms of this swap, Pickle receives $SUSHI, and SushiSwap receives $PICKLE.\n\n### What We'd Get\n\n$SUSHI has proposed giving us 40,000 $SUSHI at a generous discount. We would hold these tokens for at least a year, however, it is perfectly fine for our Treasury to deposit them as `xSUSHI` or borrow other assets against them on a lending protocol.\n\n### What We'd Give\n\nTo express our gratitude for this kind gesture, the Pickle team has agreed to propose to its governance the migration of the PICKLE-ETH liquidity incentives to MasterChefV2 in SushiSwap, where $PICKLE rewards will continue in addition to $SUSHI rewards for LPs.\n\nWe will also be giving $300,000 worth of $PICKLE tokens to the Sushi treasury at the spot price, which they will also hold for at least a year. Pickle plans to source its $300,000 worth of $PICKLE from its Smart Treasury, which currently holds 28,300 $PICKLEs (worth ~$350k at today\u2019s price). \n\nSurely, the impact to the Smart Treasury will be felt in the short term. However, since the Smart Treasury exists to benefit the development of Pickle and its ecosystem, we feel this is an appropriate use of these funds.\n\n### Replenishing the Smart Treasury\n\nOver time, the Smart Treasury would be replenished with $PICKLEs via $ETH deposits that the Treasury is currently in the process of accumulating. Those $ETH deposits are being procured with Treasury revenues, which currently hovers above 6 figures weekly.\n\n## The Vote\n\nWe invite members of the DILL DAO to give their \"aye\" or \"nay\" on this proposal.

This coincides with our launch on the Polygon network.\n\n## Background\n\nPickle Finance has had an incredible few weeks with the launch of DILL, new partnerships, and new farms on Ethereum. Now, the core team wants to embark on the L2 journey and seeks to create new opportunities for yield farmers on Polygon, as well as increase our market share in Ethereum. The decision to go with Polygon should not come as a surprise since Aave, Curve, and Sushi are already there, expanding their multi-chain visions. Moreover, partners like ComethSwap, who have previously collaborated with Pickle to great success, will be joining us for the L2 ride. \n\nPickle also wants to accelerate its growth on the Ethereum network. After reaching $100M in TVL, we want to aim for the stars and add even more farms while offering a competitive rate to depositors who choose Pickle.\n\nIn Polygon, we are looking to capture at least 50% of our current TVL with the combined incentives from $PICKLE, $MUST and $MATIC, and our novel folding strategy in Aave. Overall, we aim for our end-of-year TVL to reach the ambitious figure of $1B \u2013 EOY1B.\n\n### The Case for Increased Emissions\n\nOur experience as an emissions-based yield aggregator contrasts with a number of other protocols that have used increases in emissions to stimulate demand. That is because, since its inception, Pickle has constantly decreased or maintained fixed incentives. This is the first time an outright increase in emissions is being formally proposed to the Pickle community.\n\nTake the case of the yAxis protocol, for example. The team at yAxis was able to successfully promote an increase in emissions and drove the total value locked as deposits in the protocol from $3M in late April to $150M now, an incredible 50x return in deposits in less than 30 days. Thanks to its massive increase in TVL, the yAxis Treasury is now predicted to generate $7.5M annually from fees.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fwDX5R8.png)\n\nTo avoid the dilutive effects and encourage more $PICKLE to be locked for DILL, one option would be to allocate a percentage of the emissions increase to DILL lockers alongside the incentivization of strategies across multiple chains. The exact allocation of the distribution between DILL, Ethereum farms, and Polygon farms will be decided by the multi-sig in consultation with the core team from time to time for the duration of this expansion programme based on Pickle's strategic objectives and will be transparently communicated to the community via announcements well in advance of any changes.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe are proposing to increase the $PICKLE emission per block from 0.1 $PICKLE per block currently to:\n- (a) 0.20 $PICKLE per block; or,\n- (b) 0.30 $PICKLE per block.\n\nPickle will charge 20% performance fees on Polygon, the same as it currently does on the Ethereum network. \n\nUnder this proposal, an increased $PICKLE per block will run temporarily, until 31 December 2021 at 2359 GMT. Thereafter, the $PICKLE per block shall return to 0.10 or to whatever schedule a new governance proposal decides.\n\n![](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/8GiOlkN.png)\n\nDue to the temporary nature of the increases, the impact on total supply is limited to, at most, less than 300,000 additional $PICKLEs compared to the current emissions schedule. \n\n\n## For\n\n- (a) 0.20 $PICKLE per block\n- (b) 0.30 $PICKLE per block\n\n**<u>Note<\/u>: a vote for either (a) or (b) will be counted as a vote to increase emissions.

We have identified and worked closely with 3 such protocols in Q1-2021:\n- **Basis**, the first protocol to implement the seignorage share model for next-gen stablecoins. Pickle is a strategic partner to the peg-stabilization mechanism in BasisCash v2.\n- **Terra**, a cross-chain pioneer and the team behind Mirror, a strong challenger to Synthetix, and the newer Anchor protocol for fixed stablecoin yield. Terra and Pickle are currently working on a co-promotion and will be hashing more strategies together in the near future.\n- **Alchemix**, the self-paying loan protocol, whose co-founder was once a Pickle mod and for whom we have developed a unique *symbiotic strategy* in order to cement the partnership. As a consumer of yield farming services, Alchemix is a great match for Pickle's value proposition.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, Pickle served the strong appetite for well-executed \"degen\" jars in new protocols like Basis, a strategy that gave a much-needed boost to our coffers. With the upcoming launch of DILL, we want to continue the focus on the bottom-line and instil that ethos in the first batch of DILL holders. Note that the above protocols hold $1B in available liquidity that is serviceable with our current and soon-to-launch jars. A successful launch of these jars should lead to a manifold increase in our protocol revenues (i.e. more buybacks, more revenue-sharing, more resources for growth). If we add FEI-TRIBE into the mix (a momentum play), that number grows to $1.5B. \n\nIn order to do this, and do it in a timely manner, we kindly ask the current Pickle voters, the PICKLE-ETH LPs, to wholeheartedly support this proposal. In order to complete the Pickle version of [the cryptoeconomic circle][1], we need to make some tough choices like slashing jars that have lost momentum to launch new ones as well as decreasing incentives to LPs in order to free them to increase meaningful usage of the protocol (i.e. bringing in new revenues).

The core team, having worked together in the development of DILL as well as releases of new jars, has thus identified a gap in its engineering capacity and would like to fill it by onboarding an additional smart contract developer.\n\n### Proposal\n\nEquivalent to previous engineering packages, the Pickle core team requests approval for a budget of $156k ($120k from the stablecoin reserve and $36k in $PICKLEs from the Smart Treasury) in order to fund the hire for a year.\n\n### Hiring Process\n\n-    A call for candidates will be posted on this forum, Pickle's Discord and social media, and other relevant channels.\n-    A hiring committee consisting of the Pickle core team (@Larry_Cucumber, @0xkoffee, @Unlock_Target, @purplezky, @leekuanjew, @chimaera, @anoniminis), independent multi-sig members (@jintao, @Mah_Dills), and Brinery members (@Rooster_Cogburn77, @sifu, @yyctrader) shall assemble to evaluate candidacies and conduct interviews.\n-    The hiring committee shall deliberate internally and come to a decision according to its own procedures. Any selected candidate(s) shall be extended an offer by a member of the hiring committee. \n\nThe job advertisement, below.\n\n---\n\n# In search of: Solidity\/Vyper Smart Contract Developer\n\nPickle is a yield aggregator and automated yield farming protocol on Ethereum. In its short 6 months of existence, it has gone from an elastic stablecoin farming experiment to a Yearn ecosystem member with projected revenues exceeding $6M\/year. \n\nWe are one of the smallest yet most daring teams in the DeFi space. We take pride in developing and releasing novel strategies for yield farming vaults, and in creating deep partnerships with the protocols and teams pushing the boundaries of this new and open financial system that is being built on sound, programmable money. We follow best-in-class security procedures, yet retain our \"degen\" instincts intact.\n\nWe are looking for a driven and enthusiastic smart contract developer to help us bring about the next evolution of Pickle Finance. With the aid of the Pickle core team, you will design, develop, and test the strategies and yield-generating products that will delight the growing Pickle userbase. Kudos if you are also willing and able to help contribute to our frontend, analytics, or process automation development.\n\n## Role and Responsibilities\n\n-    Design, test, and implement new yield farming strategies and tests\n-    Design, test, and implement peripheral contracts for Pickle jars\n-    Design, test, and implement peripheral mechanisms to the Pickle protocol, including governance\n\n## Must-haves\n\n-    1-3 years of experience with Solidity or Vyper, including deep familiarity with the Ethereum development stack (e.g. Hardhat, Ethers, The Graph)\n-    A deep understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n-    Prior experience deploying smart contract systems in Ethereum\n-    Deep familiarity with the foundational principles of software architecture, design patterns, test-driven development, data-driven programming, and development in an Agile environment \n-    A collaborative, can-do attitude, and a deep appreciation of the [Scrum values][1]\n\n## Nice-to-haves\n\n-    Formal training in maths, physics, computer science, computer engineering, or electrical engineering (Degree level or above)\n-    Prior experience as a developer in DeFi, particularly in yield farming applications\n-    Prior experience deploying smart contracts to non-Ethereum EVM implementations (Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, xDai)\n-    Familiarity with React, Next, and TypeScript\n-    Pickle connoisseur \ud83e\udd52\n\nPickle welcomes all qualified candidates to apply.

The RULER team has committed to providing 50 RULER per week for same period. These rewards serve to incentivize liquidity.\n\nFurther information on Ruler Protocol and background discussion can be found on the Forum thread here: https:\/\/forum.pickle.finance\/t\/rfc-pickle-ruler-collaboration\/1031.\n\n## (2) Strategic Investment by Pickle Treasury \n\nPickle Finance wishes to participate in a strategic investment with **$250,000 worth of PICKLES + stablecoins** in a preferred equity fund raising. Participants in the current funding round include Badger DAO, Consensys, Gitcoin and other prominent DeFi entities. \n\nThis investment is for a live, in-use product relating to HR services which serve the web3 workforce. Pickle Finance would receive this project's governance tokens with rewards accrued from those tokens going to the Pickle Treasury. Pickle would additionally own equity in this company and would benefit from [liquidity events](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Liquidity_event).\n\n#### The Deal\n\na) $250,000 worth of PICKLES + stablecoins for tokens entitling Pickle to governance and fee sharing rights. \nb) PICKLEs will not be sold for cash immediately as a majority of the PICKLEs will be vested over a period of 4 years. The price impact to the PICKLE token is negligible. \n\n#### Motivation\n\nCurrently, the [Pickle Treasury](https:\/\/debank.com\/profile\/0x066419eaef5de53cc5da0d8702b990c5bc7d1ab3) and [Smart Treasury](https:\/\/debank.com\/profile\/0xc52139a20a57c9002e9f5188901ef0ffc63c7205\/) contains $1.4M worth of assets. This balance is being deployed primarily for staffing purposes. We believe that making strategic investments will ensure that the protocol continues to grow by rooting ourselves in other promising projects and the greater crypto ecosystem. This is also attractive because the other party has agreed to reciprocate with an investment in PICKLE (due to the vesting schedule).    \n","protocol":"pickle","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xb4522eB2cA49963De9c3dC69023cBe6D53489C98","totalVotes":21,"blockNumber":12094207,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/pickle.eth\/proposal\/QmWPdGRGxwNBxvCoUNxeSkwEHJto2j63PcJXBZhS2ViVUG","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1616500800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1616673600}","startTimestamp":1616500800,"endTimestamp":1616673600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Proceed with (1) and (2)', 'Proceed with only Ruler', 'Proceed with only Strategic Inv.', 'Do Nothing']","results":"[{'total': 58.74737, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 4.2757306, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 10.476746, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

Clear guidelines help members to promote their ideas to become without the uncertainty created by unclear or scattered resources and guidelines. This proposal presents a life-cycle that upgrades our current processes and deliver a step-by-step guide that can be followed by any member.\n\n- [Full Discussion](https:\/\/forum.piedao.org\/t\/pip-69-governance-voting-framework\/1232)\n- Note: The proposal has received a good support on the Forum polls, showing over 90% acceptance withing the poll participants.\n\n# Motivation & Scope\n\nWe expect to address the following points to allow proposals to be positioned for voting only after achieving an execution-ready status depending on their complexity.\n\n- Segregate Complex from Simpler proposals\n- Defining an approach that uses Gates and Stages\n- Creation of a workbooks and templates\n- Define Votes types and characteristics\n- Quality assurance and community suppor through a moderator position\n\nWe propose to introduce the following changes\n\n## **1. Governance**\n\n### **1.1 Categories**\n\nVotes types are categorized in two main categories, and each one serve their own process flow\n\n- Improvement proposals\n- Generic Proposals\n\n### **1.2 Vote Types**\n\nAll votes casted in Snapshot should be following one of these categories and consider the durations given below as the minimum required for their length. Types are categorized between\u00a0**Critical** and\u00a0**Non Critical.**\n\n### **1.3 Gate Baker**\n\nModeration is a need to assure that:\n\n- Members support and education over the proposal flow\n- To assure submitted votes have met the gate-ready criterias\n- Keep a DB for the submitted roles and segregate valid from invalid votes to support the Governance Mining eligibility criteria process\n- Moderate the forum to lead conversations and keep conversations momentum and on topic.\n\n## **2. Introducing Gates**\n\nGates will act as check points designed to drive proposals efficiently and require a Snapshot vote. The amount of Gates will depend on the proposal type\n\n- **Improvement Proposals:**\u00a0Gate 1 >> Validation >> Gate 2 >> Execution\n- **Generic Proposals:**\u00a0Gate 1 >> Execution\n\n### **2.3 Considerations**\n\n- **PIP Acceptance Criteria**\n    - In order to pass a PIP: 5% or more of veDOUGH supply must participate (current_supply * 0.05 = result), and 60% or more of participating tokens must vote in favor (FOR)\n- **Maintenance**\n    - Casted votes not following the gate steps won\u2019t be considered for the Governance Mining Rewards eligibility process. The only exception will be Critical votes types.\n    - Snapshot entries will not be removed from the system.\n- **Naming Convention**\n    - Proposals can or can not have a PIP number. Either case it is expected that they follow the following naming structure to facilitate reading\n        - Without PIP # \u2192 [Gate #] Proposal title\n        - With a PIP # \u2192 [PIP-#] [Gate #] Proposal title\n\n## **3. Introducing Stages**\n\nStages are all the steps and activites that happen between gates, which do not require a Snapshot vote. They tick all the boxes for the conversation to move towards a gate vote in good shape, and determine the flow expected for the whole lyfe-cycle of each proposal type.\n\n### **3.1 Generic proposal stages**\n\n- **Forum Discussion**: Proposed Idea to be discussed in the Forum\n- **Gate 1:**\u00a0Validate the community agreement through a vote\n- **Production Release:**\u00a0Execute the proposal\n\n### **3.2 PIP stages**\n\n- **Forum Discussion:**\u00a0Proposed Idea to be discussed in the Forum\n- **PIP Gate 1:**\u00a0Gauge members support on the Idea\n- **PIP Refinement:**\u00a0Improvement Proposal refinement\n- **PIP Validation:**\u00a0Validation of Scope\n- **PIP Staging:**\u00a0Proposal pre-gate Staging\n- **PIP Gate 2:**\u00a0PIP Voting\n- **Production Release:**\u00a0Execute the proposal\n\n### **4. Processes flows charts**\n\nFlows are visual aid images to understand what to do on each step, and they vary depending on the Proposal type.\n\n- **Generic Proposal Flow**\n- **PIP Flow**\n    - **Standard Proposal Flow**\n    - **Pie Proposal Flow**\n\n# Benefits & Risks\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe PieDAO Governance process has been defined in several documents that are currently not linked to one another. This can create friction and uncertainty for users to submit ideas and for community members to visualize next steps. While studying the current status, two discussions opened the door to rethink the current Idea\u2192PIP\u2192Vote flow to include a broather set of definitions to bootstrap the whole process.\n\n## Risks\n\nNo risks identified\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf the community vote in favor of this proposal, the next steps will be:\n\n1. Manage all new votes under the approved process\n2. Kick-off the Gate Baker role to start assisting new entries\n3. Publish the process on PieDAO docs\n\n# Closing notes\n\nClarity during the process, good level of support, visibility on the next steps and MVP quality standards assurance are the key deliverables that will make us implement great products and changes and facilitate the decision making for the PieDAO community members. \n\nWe ask votes to show their support **For** or **Against** the current proposal, or to select **Detail more** if you think it\u2019s not ready yet for implementation.","protocol":"piedao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x0810C422E4abD05c752618B403d26cf60bB50B5C","totalVotes":137,"blockNumber":14159959,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/piedao.eth\/proposal\/0x050f542f2843d55d3871fd7e5ca56376bd33c3e9564ef787e86835c396992875","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644253200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644858000}","startTimestamp":1644253200,"endTimestamp":1644858000,"currentState":"active","choices":"['For', 'Against', 'Detail More']","results":"[{'total': 7550102.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 631637.25, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 56623.99, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

Protocols have the opportunity to select a LP token that yield farmers can bond [sell to the DAO] at a discount, receiving a governance token in return. For example, PieDAO could offer DOUGH in exchange for yield farmers bonding their DOUGH\/ETH LP token from Sushi.  As a result, PieDAO would add a revenue-generating LP position to the treasury and the yield farmer would acquire a discounted token from a protocol that that is now stronger financially as a result of the bonding. \n\nHere is an example of a DAO that has acquired liquidity via OlympusDAO: BanklessDAO has acquired over $588,000 in the BANK\/ETH LP token in the last couple months. If a yield farmer was to sell their position to Bankless DAO today, they would receive a 8.5% ROI [In the form of discounted BANKLESS DAO tokens] on their bonded capital. \n\n\"The problem with existing yield farms: \n\nLiquidity leaves farms at an alarming rate. 42% of yield farmers that enter a farm on the day it launches exit within 24 hours. Around 16% leave within 48 hours, and by the third day, 70% of these users would have withdrawn from the contract.\n\nThe Olympus Pro Solution:\n\nBonds vest over a period of days set by the protocol and you are free to claim any pro-rata share.

This would in fact invalidate the whole case built around the creation of incentives in order to pursue a higher % of staked DOUGH out of its entire circulating supply.\n\nThe possibility to have the KPI Option backed by veDOUGH was somehow aired since the very early convo held with the UMA tech team. Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t possible with their standard contracts, consequently the initial proposal posted on the PieDAO forum referred to DOUGH as the asset backing the KPI Options. Same for the initial snapshot vote signaling support by the community for this initiative.\n\nAs part of the discussion triggered by such proposal, the community has been further exploring the possibility to still get veDOUGH as asset backing the KPI Options, requiring the development of a wrapper taking care of converting the KPI Option to veDOUGH at expiration. This solution was eventually conceptualized and developed shortly after by the core team for the reasons above.\n\nIn order to avoid gray areas on which should eventually be the asset to be distributed at expiration of the KPI Options (March 2022), we would propose to the community to formally select one among the 3 following solutions:\n\nA) Options redeemed as veDough\nB) Options redeemed as Dough\nC) Both A & B + an incentive to choose veDough\n\nSPECIFICALLY\nOption A) corresponds to the current implementation of the KPI Option, developed by putting the above mentioned wrapper in place that allows options to be redeemed automatically as veDough. Main benefit of this option is undoubtedly the possibility to avoid selling pressure on our governance token DOUGH, while at the same time incentivizing the long term alignment from our community members to PieDAO.\n\nOption B) Options redeemed liquid as DOUGH, with the main downside being its dilution and negative price impact, and the extra cost for those willing to eventually stake those tokens to veDOUGH.\n\nOption C) User would select either A or B at the conversion of the KPI Options. This would provide the option to allow each address to choose whether or not to stake their tokens, with unknown effect on the DOUGH Circulation supply and price. Additionally, as per the forum discussion, further incentives will be discussed if this option is chosen in order to drive users towards veDough.","protocol":"piedao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x0810C422E4abD05c752618B403d26cf60bB50B5C","totalVotes":136,"blockNumber":13888882,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/piedao.eth\/proposal\/0x355ea2dda8d825ccda50b367719d1ad6d85f1786f1b177196eec9fc8dd94c810","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640630700}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1640988000}","startTimestamp":1640630700,"endTimestamp":1640988000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['(A) Redeemed as veDough', '(B) Redeemed as Dough', '(C) Allow veDough and Dough']","results":"[{'total': 3112389, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 5816.132, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 1891686.6, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

The 9 smallest allocations account for 10% of PLAY in total\n-> Thin liquidity on DEXes for several assets \n\n## Specification\nFew issues seem to currently represent a bottleneck to PLAY' scalability:\n\n1) Several items compose a \u201clong tail\u201d of not very meaningful allocations (the sum of 9 smallest allocations account for 10% of PLAY in total), despite having introduced a min 2% allocation for each asset during the past rebalance.\nIn order to position PLAY on multiple venues (L2 included) PieDAO could be ideally leveraging on some professional support for its market making (MM). Still this long tail makes the required hedging almost impossible for many underlying assets.\n\n2) The thin liquidity available on DEXes for several assets is representing a concrete bottleneck for the minting of decent-sized batches of PLAY. Furthermore, for assets with most of liquidity on Uniswap V3, this can result even more challenging due to its range-concentrated allocation.\nThe need to limit the size of each batch exponentially boost up the gas cost incurred when minting liquidity for PLAY. \nVice-versa, the minting of bigger batches incurs in consistent slippage.\n\n## Proposed solutions\nA possible way to address the above issues would include the following solutions:\n\n**A) Removing all assets with negligible liquidity on DEXes + capping the allocation of each asset so to always keep its slippage below 2% when minting PLAY** (this by making each asset\u2019s allocation also a function of its DEX liquidity)\n\n**B) Drastically cutting the current long tail of micro-allocation**, bringing the PLAY underlying assets down to the 8 most relevant assets\n\nThe joint application of both solutions proposed (A + B) would result in an allocation optimised form a liquidity standpoint, allowing the minting of up to $1m of PLAY in a single transaction, with total slippage < 1%.\n\n## Do you support any of these solutions proposed to optimize the PLAY scalability?","protocol":"piedao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xaBf26352aAdAAa1CabFfB3a55e378bac6BF15791","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13692554,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/piedao.eth\/proposal\/0x62134c543c519293411638a2bd634ed2af1a6cdc6b6b6281d5d33dcdc8a785cb","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637971200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1638399540}","startTimestamp":1637971200,"endTimestamp":1638399540,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['I Support both A & B', 'I Support A, do NOT support B', 'I Support B, do NOT support A', 'I do NOT support A & B']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

Only eDOUGH that has vested for 6+months will be eligible for this bridge. Additionally we propose that unclaimed rewards be made claimable as 100% veDOUGH (i.e. no 80-20 split) with a 6month time lock.\n\n## Background\nTreasury farming will soon be launching for PieDao, this means those who hold DOUGH (distinct from the token eDOUGH) will be able to stake for a yield payed out in the new SLICE pie. DOUGH is the governance token for PieDao while eDough is an escrowed version of the token payed out to those who support the dao by providing liquidity. The proposal that implemented this change did not discuss what would occur with eDOUGH.\n\n## Motivation\nCurrently we are faced with a handful of issues, in no particular order:\n\neDough is ineligible for its previous only function - voting.\nThis may be desirable for those who purchased Dough on the open market as excluding those who have previously committed capital to the Dao would give them an advantage in % of those staking, however I think the cost of this (alienating those previously assisting the Dao, possibly of sell pressure) outweighs the APR gain.Those who hold mostly eDough will have the majority of their funds excluded from first (several?) month of rewards already.\n\neDough positions will begin unlocking in November which may begin a sell off in the market\nFor obvious reasons it is always desirable to alleviate sell pressure.\n\nAs a PieDao LP you will soon need to perform 3 actions to fully take advantage of rewards\nClaim eDough Rewards -> swap to Dough -> stake for veDough. All at mainnet prices and, for our American friends, with complicated tax implications.\n\n## Specification\nWe propose to solve the above issues a bridge be constructed to swap eDough to 3-year locked veDough with no option to configure the time lock. Preventing time lock configuration means the most benefit for the DAO as it guarantees long term commitment to the protocol while also maximizing the reward for the individual. Only eDough that has vested for 6months would be eligible for this bridge to prevent mass inflation of veDough. Those who are very close to the end of their escrow period and do not wish to stake (or swap to veDough) can exit their position and the normal time. In doing this we relieve a great deal of sell pressure, allow holders of eDough to enter into a staked position with only 1 transaction, realign all community interests, and effectively re-enable eDough holders voting rights.\n\nAdditionally, we propose that all claimable rewards be made claimable as 100% 6month staked veDough versus the existing 20% Dough 80% eDough scheme. This resolve issues LPs run into in the number of mainnet transactions required to full utilize their rewards and increases time lock in the protocol, further decreases sell pressure, and encourages investment in the protocol.\n\nThese two above solutions may launch at separate times due to complexity differences in implementation or other issues.\n\n## Do you agree to the creation of an eDOUGH to veDOUGH bridge?","protocol":"piedao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x79939118Ef2af99E20310eCC5CCC0E9697d390FC","totalVotes":119,"blockNumber":13591326,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/piedao.eth\/proposal\/0xaf04cb5391de0cb3d9c9e694a2bf6e5d20f0e4e1c48e0a1d6f85c5233aa580b6","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1636563600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1636995600}","startTimestamp":1636563600,"endTimestamp":1636995600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 5572362, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 3639.7805, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This proposal will transfer sponsorship tokens to the executive team, who will distribute the tokens appropriately.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal will transfer $350k ScUSDC to the Executive Team.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPoolTogether is currently subsidizing prizes across all V4 prize pools.  Because liquidity is being consumed faster than interest builds, we need to explicitly transfer tickets into the Prize Distributor contracts.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis proposal will transfer ScUSDC tokens to the Executive Team.   The executive team will unwrap those tokens as needed and deposit them into V4 prize pools.  The Executive Team lead will decide how to balance the funds across prize pools and set up the transactions.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal is transferring $350k ScUSDC because that is approximately the amount of prizes given out over one month.  This proposal will give us another month of runway.\n\n\n# PTIP-53: Executive Team Budget\n\nThis proposal will fund the Executive Team for 6 months. The Executive Team will operate according to the structure outlined below.\n\n# Executive Team\n\nThe Executive Team controls key PoolTogether V4 smart contracts using Gnosis Safes that are deployed across Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. The members and required confirmations for each Safe are identical.\n\n- [Executive Team Ethereum Safe](https:\/\/gnosis-safe.io\/app\/#\/safes\/0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693\/balances)\n- [Executive Team Polygon Safe](https:\/\/polygon.gnosis-safe.io\/app\/#\/safes\/0x3feE50d2888F2F7106fcdC0120295EBA3ae59245\/balances)\n- [Executive Team Avalanche Safe](https:\/\/gnosis-safe.io\/app\/avax:0x6323A881Ea07f64dD8ec67B15fBB5dC6383eFAc6\/balances)\n\n## Current Membership\n\nThe current executive team members are listed below.

This is so that we can quickly fix smart contracts and because PT governance does not currently extend to Polygon or Avalanche. The executive team **must** act in accordance with the wishes of governance. The wishes of governance can be expressed as an explicit order, or as a broader mandate.\n\n## Governance Orders\n\nGovernance can order the executive team to do anything. Practically, this will largely be adjusting prize distribution and replacing contracts.\n\nFor example: the prize distribution was changed recently in [PTIP-47: Prize Adjustments](https:\/\/gov.pooltogether.com\/t\/ptip-47-prize-adjustments\/1752). POOL token holders signalled they wished the prize distribution to change, and the executive team followed through on the order.\n\n## Governance Mandates\n\nThe executive team has several broad mandates from governance, which include:\n\n- Distributing prize liquidity to Prize Distributor contracts\n- Taking emergency actions with the smart contracts\n\nThe executive team can be proactive here and act unilaterally to fulfill its mandate.\n\n# Executive Team Lead & Members\n\nThe executive team will appoint a lead that is in charge of ensuring orders are executed and mandates met. Team members will be required to verify and confirm transactions set up by the lead.\n\n## Team Lead\n\nThe executive team lead's current responsibilities include:\n\n- Executing explicit governance orders\n- Re-balancing prize liquidity\n- Requesting more prize liquidity with proposals to governance\n- Removing team members\n- Distributing compensation\n- Ensuring Gnosis Safe wallets are identical across all chains\n\nIf a team lead ceases to fulfill their role, then the executive team will need to appoint a new one and (possibly) remove the old one.\n\n## Team Members\n\nTeam members will do their best to verify and confirm legitimate transactions. The team lead will contact them when their signature is needed.\n\n# Managing Membership\n\nIt's very important that team members are available and actively participating, otherwise the executive team will cease to function.\n\n## Removing Members\n\nExecutive team members may decide to leave, ghost, or misbehave.\n\n- If a member wants to leave, then the lead can remove them from all Safes.\n- If a team member has not signed a transaction in two months, then the lead must remove them from all Safes. This is the **Ghost Rule**.\n- If a team member misbehaves, then it is up to the executive team how they wish to handle the situation.\n\nWhenever a member is removed from a Safe, the confirmation level is adjusted to maintain an approximately 2\/3 ratio to membership.\n\n### Ghost Rule\n\nIf a member has not signed a transaction in two months, then they are removed from all Safes. The Ghost Rule should be checked once per month **before members are paid out**. When the ghost rule is activated the member does not receive compensation for that month and they are removed from the team.\n\n## Adding Members\n\nNew members of the executive team must be voted in by a governance order. This helps ensure the team doesn't become a cabal. Confirmations are adjusted to maintain an approximately 2\/3 ratio to membership.\n\n# Compensation\n\nTo ensure we attract high-quality members, compensation should be robust. It should also be split between POOL tokens and stablecoins, so that the member earns ownership but also has cash to spend.\n\nThe Pool Grants committee has based their compensation on a rate of $100 \/ hour. We will do the same.\n\nI estimate that the team lead will need approximately 30 hours per month to fulfill their duties. Some weeks will be less, others more. Until we have better tooling, the lead will need to navigate explorers to calculate liquidity levels, view member activity to check the Ghost Rule, and potentially construct complex transactions (among other things!).\n\nTeam members will need to be available for signing, which can take several steps. In addition, they should take the time to verify the transaction validity (when possible). I would estimate they will need approximately 10 hours per month to fulfill their duties.\n\n| Role | Monthly Hours | Monthly Compensation |\n| ---- | ------------ | -------------------- |\n| Team Lead | 30 | $3000 USD |\n| Team Member | 4 | $400 USD |\n\nThe compensation will be split 50\/50 between USDC and POOL, for simplicity.\n\nCompensation is paid once per month **after** the Ghost Rule is applied. The team lead sets up the payouts. This can be done efficiently using the Gnosis Safe batching mechanism.\n\n## Gas\n\nThe Team Lead will be the person that executes the Gnosis Safe transactions.

Extend prizes and drip for the POOL pool as well. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe POOL drips for most Ethereum pools will be ending within the next 2 weeks ([see details here](https:\/\/info.pooltogether.com\/faucets)). This proposal serves to maintain the status quo of POOL incentives on Ethereum. However, it only extends the status quo for a relatively short amount of additional time. This is because the V4 prize pool will be launching in mid October and a larger incentive overhaul will be warranted then. \n\n### Rationale\n\nThis proposal is positioned mostly as an administrative change. It is possible we could use this as an opportunity to adjust drip rates, simply let the current drips expire or make some other type of more aggressive change. I'm open to those suggestions but my personal thought is it's best to keep this simple and roll out bigger changes with the V4 launch.  \n\n### Technical Specification\n\n- Transfer POOL to the faucets for Dai, USDC, Sushi, UNI, COMP, POOL, \n- End sablier prize stream to POOL pool\n- Begin new prize stream to POOL pool \n\nNote that to combine this with PTIP-38 we're sending POOL to the eth ops team for disbursal.  1550 POOL will go to each of the UNI and COMP pools, and 1300 POOL will be swapped for PPOOL and deposited into the Sushi pool.\n\nFor the POOL Pool prizes the old Sablier prize stream will be cancelled and a new \"Prize Chunker\" contract used to stream prizes.\n\n\n# PTIP-38: Increase Ethereum Operations Team Budget\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe Ethereum Operations Team needs to increase its budget due to cost of mainnet transactions.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis PTIP will add a new stream to the current Ethereum Operations Team.  The new stream will be 210k ScUSDC.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOver the last eight days 2 ETH has been consumed by the Defender relayer.  The relayer is:\n\n- Rewarding the prize pools\n- Running Pod batching\n- Claiming COMP for Compound Pools\n\nThe gas cost is about 1.75 ETH \/ week.  At current Ethereum prices that's about $5300 USD \/ week.\n\nThis number does not include LINK costs.\n\n$5300 x 52 = $275600, so we're going to ballpark the budget at $300,000.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis PTIP will:\n\n- cancel the old Sablier stream (stream id 100260)\n- create a new Sablier stream for 300k ScUSDC over one year\n","protocol":"pooltogether","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9aBad5d367565425a11aB0446cdc1CD3F38a0bd8","totalVotes":13,"blockNumber":13273053,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13273053}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13301853}","startTimestamp":1632280013,"endTimestamp":1632666063,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 102025.336, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13303340}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1632684948}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13316230}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1632858523}]"}

POOL pool APR should be in line with that of the deposit pools and the goal is also to attract more POOL pool depositors.\n\nGUSD is a new pool that we should be trying to grow and allowing depositors to earn POOL is the best path to growth. This pool also earns Aave for the protocol and that is the reasoning for not applying the standard 50% reserve that is used in the Compound pools.\n\nSushi pool sushi rewards end soon and in anticipation of continuing the pool we should set a new reserve rate and drip 50 POOL per day to maintain the pool.\n\nMost of the Compound prize comes from the Compound rewards.

Increase the number of weekly winners to the following\n  Dai Prize Pool: From 3 to 5 winners\n\n2. Instead of giving all the accrued COMP to the \u201cgrand prize\u201d winner, split the accrued COMP among all winners equally for all prize pools (Dai, USDC, COMP, UNI)\n\n3. Increase the number of POOL pool winners from 1 to 5\n\n### Overview\n\nThis should be considered phase 1 of Operation Little Fish. This phase uses the levers immediately at the control of governance (i.e. no new solidity code written). It will meaningfully adjust the odds to favor smaller depositors by. **Phase 2 is in R&D and will expand on this same goal.**\n\nNOTE: the same wallet can win multiple prizes. So large whales will still win many of the prizes but far less of the total prizes than today.\n\n### Rationale\n\nPoolTogether is currently a victim of its own success. With over $200 million deposited, $100,000+ in weekly prizes, and prize pool reserves growing things are going better than ever. BUT, deposits into the prize pools have become increasingly dominated by large depositors. We\u2019ve gone from the majority of prizes being won by large depositors to almost all of them being won by large whales. We need more depositors like the person [who deposited $73 and won $43,000. ](https:\/\/medium.com\/pooltogether\/pooltogether-myths-6d1a91d283a0) The core value proposition of PoolTogether is giving people the chance to get an outsized return on their money without risking it. Having more prizes means the odds of winning increase and this value proposition becomes stronger. PoolTogether becomes more FUN.\n\nThe change to the POOL pool to emphasize staking APR over a weekly prize also helps improve returns for POOL hodlers.\n\nThere are other methods to achieve this goal that the community has discussed. Specifically the idea of moving the POOL incentive to \u201csponsored\u201d deposits that are not eligible to win. This idea has merit (I\u2019ve been a proponent of it) but has some key limitations.\n\n* Adding a second token \u201cdrip\u201d will increase gas costs for all users (TBD on exactly how much)\n* We will likely still have whales winning all the prizes, the whales will have the same % of total deposits but a smaller deposit in absolute numbers\n* We risk losing a lot of capital in the migration\n* We lose the benefits of having the value propo of \u201ca chance to win + an APR\u201d for depositors\n* The value prop of sponsorship becomes solely yield farming which is not competitive for us long term\n\nUltimately this is the simplest change to immediately and meaningfully help out small depositors. Phase 2 of the operation will expand on this same goal.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\n1. Set Dai prize pool number of winners to 5\n2. Split Dai prize pool rewards\n3. Split USDC prize pool rewards\n4. Split COMP prize pool rewards\n5. Split UNI prize pool rewards\n6. Set POOL Pool number of winners to 5\n\n## Status\n\nThis proposal was [extensively discussed and supported widely here](https:\/\/gov.pooltogether.com\/t\/ptip-22-operation-10x-saving-the-little-fishes-phase-1\/1250).

{"refId":"cHJvcG9zYWw6cG9vbHRvZ2V0aGVyOmRlZmF1bHQ6MTU=","id":"15","title":"PTIP 16: C4 Audit  +  PTIP 17: Sponsorship","content":"# PTIP-16: C4 Audit\n\nThis proposal will fund a [Code Arena](https:\/\/code423n4.com\/) (C4) contest to audit the critical components of the PoolTogether codebase as well as new yield sources.\n\nThe audit is tentatively scheduled for June 16, but it's first-come first-served so it depends on how quickly we can run this PTIP.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal will transfer 72k USDC to the C4 team to fund the contest.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPoolTogether is continually evolving and expanding.  New smart contracts are being written and existing contracts are updated.  With these changes some significant risk.  Any smart contract that holds or has access to user funds is mission critical and must be scrutinized before being deployed.  Scrutiny must come from someone with deep knowledge of the relevant protocols as well as an understanding of smart contract attack surfaces.  Auditing firms specialize in this knowledge, so they are extremely valuable in de-risking smart contracts.\n\nThe core PoolTogether codebase has received third party audits from both OpenZeppelin and Diligence.  Both are great firms, and we\u2019ve had positive experiences with them.  However, auditing firms are in short supply and lead times are now very long.  Additionally, our protocol has a steady stream of new smart contracts that need to be audited.  The classic \u2018waterfall\u2019 model of auditing the entire system in one shot no longer fits our process.  We also need an auditing firm that is willing to deal directly with protocols.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis PTIP funds the first C4 auditing contest for PoolTogether.  The scope of this contest includes several of the critical core PT contracts, as well as yield sources:\n\nCore PoolTogether contracts:\n\n- [YieldSourcePrizePool.sol](https:\/\/github.com\/pooltogether\/pooltogether-pool-contracts\/blob\/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508\/contracts\/prize-pool\/yield-source\/YieldSourcePrizePool.sol)\n- [StakePrizePool.sol](https:\/\/github.com\/pooltogether\/pooltogether-pool-contracts\/blob\/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508\/contracts\/prize-pool\/stake\/StakePrizePool.sol)\n- [ControlledToken.sol](https:\/\/github.com\/pooltogether\/pooltogether-pool-contracts\/blob\/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508\/contracts\/token\/ControlledToken.sol)\n- [Ticket.sol](https:\/\/github.com\/pooltogether\/pooltogether-pool-contracts\/blob\/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508\/contracts\/token\/Ticket.sol)\n\nYield sources:\n\n- [ATokenYieldSource.sol](https:\/\/github.com\/pooltogether\/aave-yield-source\/blob\/bc65c875f62235b7af55ede92231a495ba091a47\/contracts\/yield-source\/ATokenYieldSource.sol) (Aave V2 Integration)\n- [YearnV2YieldSource.sol](https:\/\/github.com\/pooltogether\/pooltogether-yearnv2-yield-source\/blob\/a34857f1555908a6263d2ebd189f0cb40e1858da\/contracts\/yield-source\/YearnV2YieldSource.sol) (Yearn V2 integration)\n- [SushiYieldSource.sol](https:\/\/github.com\/pooltogether\/pooltogether-yearnv2-yield-source\/blob\/a34857f1555908a6263d2ebd189f0cb40e1858da\/contracts\/yield-source\/SushiYieldSource.sol) (SushiBar integration)\n- [IdleYieldSource.sol](https:\/\/github.com\/sunnyRK\/IdleYieldSource-PoolTogether\/blob\/6dcc419e881a4f0f205c07c58f4db87520b6046d\/contracts\/IdleYieldSource.sol) (Idle Finance integration)\n- Badger wBTC Yield Source (TBD)\n\nCode Arena has scoped the contest and recommends a 50-70k USD prize pot.  We\u2019re going to put up 60k USDC for prizes, and allocate 10k of the pot to optimizations.  C4 takes 20% on top of the prizes to cover the cost of judging and administration.  That makes the total 72k USDC.\n\n### Rationale\n\n[Code Arena](https:\/\/code423n4.com\/)  takes a community-driven approach to competitive smart contract audits. A contest is created for a codebase; there is a pot of funds for exploits, and another for optimizations.  Anyone can privately submit exploits to the contest and a skilled expert, the \u201cjudge\u201d, curates the exploits into a final audit report.  The prizes are split among all who contributed to the audit report.  This has some major advantages:\n\n- Less resource-constrained\n- Builds a knowledgeable community around participating protocols\n\nTo bootstrap the C4 community\u2019s knowledge of PoolTogether, we should start with a comprehensive up-front audit.  Once the knowledge has been seeded, we can start running more frequent flash contests; wherein a small piece of code (think: yield source) can have a short, dedicated contest.  I think this would be a great fit for our iterative process.\n\nIdeally, flash contests can be funded by the PT Grants Committee.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nUSDC.transfer(0xC2bc2F890067C511215f9463a064221577a53E10, 72000000000)\n\n# PTIP-17\n\nDeposit the $4.5 million of USDC currently sitting in the [timelock](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x42cd8312D2BCe04277dD5161832460e95b24262E) contract into the sponsorship of the USDC prize pool. For voting purposes, combine this action with PTIP-16.  \n\n## Motivation\n\nThis $4.2 million USDC was deposited into the time lock contract as part of the treasury diversification. It was suppose to be transferred in sponsorship tokens (in fact $1.15 million of it was) but due to transfer security constraints the remainder was not transferred as sponsorship. \n\nTransferring into sponsorship simply means this USDC will be contributing value to the protocol and growing larger prizes while we decide what else we may want to use it for. \n\n## Technical Specification\n\nUSDC Pool = 0xde9ec95d7708b8319ccca4b8bc92c0a3b70bf416\nUSDC = 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\n\nUSCD.approve(USDC Pool, 4728000000000)\nUSDCPool.depositTo(\n  0x42cd8312D2BCe04277dD5161832460e95b24262E,\n  4728000000000,\n  0x391a437196c81eEa7BBbBd5ED4DF6b49De4F5c96,\n  0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n)\n\n","protocol":"pooltogether","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9aBad5d367565425a11aB0446cdc1CD3F38a0bd8","totalVotes":31,"blockNumber":12550407,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 12550407}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 12579207}","startTimestamp":1622574587,"endTimestamp":1622959847,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 600287.9, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 12581861}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1622994664}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 12594931}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1623169329}]"}

Those markets can then sustain themselves on-chain driven by the capital efficiency provided by Premia\u2019s market-driven options pricing. This is exciting for protocols looking to create capital-efficient opportunities for users within their ecosystem. \n\nProtocol Owned Options Liquidity (POOL), as a new liquidity primitive, allows DAOs and Protocols to bootstrap options\/volatility markets for their native tokens. POOL inherently assists in the reduction of sell-side volatility in two ways:\n\n1. Providing a token-sink (the CALL pool), where LPs can deposit protocol tokens for yield and option purchasers can potentially acquire their token of choice at a discount to the spot market through capital-efficient options trades.\n\n2. Providing downside hedging opportunities (in the PUT pool), where LPs can deposit stablecoins for yield and option purchasers can hedge their downside exposure, without selling protocol tokens, in a capital-efficient manner.\n\nIn addition to reducing downside volatility, protocols that take advantage of POOL can earn an additional source of revenue for their treasury by activating idle native assets through a supporting options\/volatility market on Premia. Protocols can earn fees in the form of premiums in the respective pool token, while also taking advantage of the $PREMIA rewards allocated to their respective pools from our Liquidity Mining program.\n\nThis provides many of the benefits of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL), popularized by OHM, in a symbiotic manner with existing POL systems. Protocol Owned DEX Liquidity provides deeper liquidity to smooth volatility on the DEX sell-side, whereas Protocol Owned Options Liquidity helps significantly reduce sell-side volatility by providing both a token sink, where users can still obtain discounted tokens, and access a new market to hedge downside risks.\n\nWhen a protocol has both POL & POOL, they are able to deepen their DEX liquidity, while also providing a healthy risk market for users to earn an additional yield on the native token, as well as hedge protocol risk. Hence, there is a strong symbiosis between POL and POOL.\n\n**Specification and Implementation**\nAny asset with a Chainlink Price Feed can have a Zero Liquidity Market created. Data collection for surface creation takes approximately one week, after which, a Protocol\/DAO needs only to agree to supply assets to a market for one to be supported.\n\nAsset markets and emission allocations must be approved by governance vote by the community via Snapshot prior to any live launch. As our first POOL partner, Premia is looking to support Alchemix and their alAssets. Two separate risk markets will be created:\n\n- ALCX [call] \/ DAI [put]\n- alETH [call] \/ alUSD [put]\n\nEmissions would be allocated for a minimum of 1 month, and a weekly review allows the community to shift those weights based on the pool\u2019s utilization rates until a more permanent system (vePREMIA) is put in place.\n\nWe are excited about the addition of these token pairs to the platform. Alchemix is a staple in DeFi, pioneering their self-repaying loan mechanism. The addition of their protocol token market will add value for Premia users who would like exposure to more DeFi-native assets.\n\nAlchemix users will also be happy to find market-competitive yield on their alAssets (alETH and alUSD), while Premia users will be excited by potential new arbitrage opportunities this pool is likely to introduce as it moves toward market efficiency. Since each alETH is backed 1:1 by ETH and alUSD 1:1 by DAI, this is likely to create arbitrage opportunities between the existing ETH\/DAI pool and the new alETH\/alUSD pool.\n\n**Motivation**\nAs our first POOL partner, we'd like to welcome Alchemix warmly to the Premia family. There are many interesting ways that Premia and Alchemix could integrate with one another and we see this as the beginning of a fruitful partnership to begin unlocking the next generation of capital-efficient yields and options markets.\n\n**Clarification**\nProtocol emissions began in November at 0.5 PREMIA per block and were raised to 0.75 PREMIA per block in December with the deployment on Arbitrum, to incentivize the additional pools. The emission rate was then voted to be decreased back to 0.5 PREMIA per block and emissions to be weighted heavier on Arbitrum (0.125 to Mainnet, 0.375 to Arbitrum). \n\nThe current pool emission weight allocations per asset group are as follows (on both chains):\n\n- WETH: (50%) \n- WBTC: (33.33%)\n- LINK: (16.66%)\n\nWith the addition of the Alchemix pools on Mainnet, the proposed Mainnet allocations are as follows (Arbitrum weights will stay the same, as no pools are being added on Arbitrum):\n\n- WETH (35%)\n- WBTC (25%)\n- alETH (15%)\n- ALCX (15%)\n- LINK (10%)\n\nGiven the addition of these two new markets, per-block emissions can either maintain the current rate of 0.5 PREMIA per block or be raised to the previous amount of 0.75 PREMIA per block to provide additional support with minimal dilution.\n\n- Vote in Favor\/In Support of: Keep 0.5 PREMIA per block (0.125 to Mainnet, 0.375 to Arbitrum)\n\n- Vote in Favor\/In Support of: 0.75 PREMIA per block (0.375 to Mainnet, 0.375 to Arbitrum)\n\n- Vote Against\/In Opposition of: adding emissions to the ALCX markets","protocol":"premia","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xDEAD5D3c486AcE753c839e2EB27BacdabBA06dD6","totalVotes":27,"blockNumber":14025602,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/premia.eth\/proposal\/0xe925f3c3b52fad3c8c7b696d6accf967a80ef1e7f92043b50a612fe4bb8eb170","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642460400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642633200}","startTimestamp":1642460400,"endTimestamp":1642633200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Keep 0.5 PREMIA per block', 'Support 0.75 PREMIA per block', 'Do not incentivize ALCX markets']","results":"[{'total': 76832.516, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1427295.1, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

The additional 0.25 PREMIA was temporary to stimulate L2 activity while not disincentivizing LP's on L1. The market has shown that Arbitrum is the preferred network (for the time being) to utilize the Premia platform and the incentives should align with the data.\n\nProposal:\nImmediately after a passing vote, reduce L1 emissions to 0.25 (a 33% reduction) PREMIA per block.\n\nThis emission rate would continue for 1 month before L1 emissions drop to 0.125.

In addition, xPREMIA has only a single source of revenue from protocol fees. This proposal would create an additional source of revenue to grow the treasury and increase PREMIA staking rewards. The idea would be to invest 50% of treasury ETH funds into stETH, the Lido staking token, and allocating 80% of those returns to PREMIA stakers and retaining the remaining 20% in the treasury.\n\nSpecification and Implementation\n--\nPremia would invest 6,000 treasury ETH, roughly 50%, into stETH with a current staking rate of ~4.9% APY. This swap would occur on the open market to capture the ETH\/stETH premium. Lido is a reputable leader in staking Ethereum and is responsible for staking $6.8 billion. They have been utilized by several other protocols for treasury diversification as well. In addition, stETH tokens are highly liquid and would create a long-term, sustainable way to incentivize PREMIA staking.\n\nMuch like protocol fees are collected now, 80% of staking rewards from the stETH investment would be collected and converted to PREMIA and distributed to xPREMIA holders. The remaining 20% would remain in stETH.\n\nPremia is fortunate to not have a substantial amount of the treasury in PREMIA tokens.

The re-addition of liquidity mining incentives will be an excellent tool to decentralize the supply of PREMIA to community members providing liquidity to the options pools. However, the emissions rate may cause supply dilution as liquidity providers compound their rewards. By implementing an Olympus Pro bond program for PREMIA-ETH liquidity, Premia can distribute its native tokens to loyal protocol users, while accumulating meaningful liquidity for the protocol.\n\n**Abstract:**\nCurrently, PREMIA has approximately $12 million in liquidity on Sushiswap in the PREMIA-ETH pool and could benefit greatly from having deeper liquidity.\nThe proposed bond program would exchange PREMIA at a discount in return for PREMIA\/ETH LP tokens through the Olympus Pro protocol. Current liquidity mining programs reward liquidity providers with tokens like PREMIA in exchange for temporary liquidity, which exposes those providers to impermanent loss from fluctuations in the underlying assets. Bonds allow active users to stack PREMIA tokens at a discount while removing the exposure to IL. The discount rate on bonds is achieved by a novel pricing mechanism that allows the market to set the discount. Essentially, bond prices are decreased until a bond is purchased, which then pushes up the price of the next bond. For reference, here is the average discount of Olympus\u2019 bonds with their extremely high APY: https:\/\/dune.xyz\/queries\/74112\/147618\n\n**Olympus Pro**\nOlympus is offering to provide its expertise in bond contract management to support other protocols interested in owning their own liquidity. This will include providing the UI for bonds and maintaining bond control variables to balance emissions with liquidity accumulation. In exchange for the implementation and community engagement, Olympus would take a fee on all PREMIA bonds sold. Olympus will use the PREMIA earned as backing for the intrinsic value of OHM, which would act as a supply sink for PREMIA.\n\n**Proposed Bond Program:**\nPREMIA bonds would be offered with a week-long vesting period, which helps prevent immediate price impact from discounted tokens. This aligns the goals of the protocol with those of bond participants. Typically, higher bond volume is seen when users expect the price of the token to increase during the vesting period.\n\n**Proposal**\nGauge community support for the allocation of $250k worth of Premia towards one month of optional bonds via Olympus Pro, beginning November 8th. If the program is a success and the community would like to continue the bonding liquidity program past the ending of this, a new proposal would be published for voting.\n\n**Success criteria**\n- Average discount rate < 8% on bonded PREMIA\n- Minimal impact on PREMIA price\n\n**Benefits**\n- Permanent liquidity source\n- Increased treasury value from liquidity that also earns trading fees\n- Exposure to paired asset in liquidity pool (ETH)\n- Premia can stake its LP tokens to provide additional runway for incentive programs\n\n**Risks**\n- Additional PREMIA emissions via bonds will increase supply dilution.\n\n","protocol":"premia","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xDEAD5D3c486AcE753c839e2EB27BacdabBA06dD6","totalVotes":51,"blockNumber":13471788,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/premia.eth\/proposal\/QmSiGxPFGKCCBn2rmGtHt3nvTRV2ZaLpHZS9dd89n9nmpa","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1634968800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1635228000}","startTimestamp":1634968800,"endTimestamp":1635228000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['In favor of: Join Olympus Pro', 'Against: Do not join Olympus Pro']","results":"[{'total': 743163.94, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 636999.5, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

A shortfall event can be caused by any number of reasons such as exploits, unknown corner cases, unexpected behavior within the smart contract ecosystem, etc.  A safety module allows Premia stakers to secure the protocol in return for protocol incentives.\n\nSpecification and Implementation\n-\nA safety module (SM) would be created as a primary mechanism to secure the protocol in the case of a financial shortfall event.  A financial shortfall occurs when there is a deficit in the system caused by any number of reasons (exploit, unexpected SC behavior, etc.) and a backstop is needed to restore the deficit and make users whole.\n\nTo compensate users for the risk they are taking in helping to secure the protocol, SM stakers will receive incentives in the form of additional yield via PREMIA emissions.  The SM incentive rate will be decided by the Premia team in conjunction with the community to find the appropriate balance of incentives to the risk being taken.  The emission rate can be adjusted via governance vote.  To prevent gaming of the SM a cooldown of 7 days will be placed on unstaked tokens.\n\nThe specific technical implementation details of the SM will be decided by the team.

This cover protects the user from a number of scenario's that would cause a loss of funds such as exploits and smart contract failure.\n\nDue to the increased risk of newly launched protocols it is often difficult to get Nexus Mutual risk assessors to stake their capital in these risk pools.  Shield mining was created as a way for protocols to provide additional incentivizes to risk assessors to compensate the additional risk they are taking on.

So, we are hoping to do token swaps with our strategic partners.\n\nSummary\nAfter discussions with the Olympus Partnerships contributors - PrimeDAO seeks to partner with Olympus asking for a swap of $250k in OHM - in return for 500k Prime Tokens (0.5% supply). Olympus would join Gitcoin and Balancer - who are partnering with PrimeDAO on similar terms.\n\nMotivation\n\nOlympusDAO is one of the DAOs we have been in close contact with, as we integrated some of the Olympus DAO contributors\u2019 valuable feedback into our process for researching and designing Prime Deals.\n\nDuring these interactions, we have come to realize an exceptional alignment between Olympus and PrimeDAO: PrimeDAO\u2019s product suite offers collaboration as service, and Olympus offers service as collaboration in its quest to evolve into an ecosystem-wide behemoth for advanced treasury management. In theory, there is no limit on how many DAOs can be integrated into Olympus\u2019 D2D partnerships which span incubation, co-liquidity provision, OlympusPRO, token swaps, and many more to come. However, there is a limit to how many partnership pipelines the Olympus team can handle. PrimeDAO helps Olympus to scale its operational capacity by making the whole experience of negotiating and venturing with other DAOs a lot more efficient in multiple layers. On PrimeDAO\u2019s side, partnering with Olympus would allow PrimeDAO to onboard the DAOs in Olympus\u2019 ally network into its services.\n\nOlympus receiving Prime tokens will allow it to have a say over Prime\u2019s governance from day one. It will also enable us to coordinate in a more aligned and intimate setting, giving each other a concrete representation to voice our needs as we iterate on our products moving forward.\n\nThere are a large numbers of areas we see for collaboration with Olympus as we roll-out - including:\n\nOlympus <> Prime Deals\n\nHave Olympus participate in the testing phase of token swap on Prime Deals, and if both parties agree, onboard Olympus on to Prime Deals for their future token swaps.\nCreate an open deal template customized for negotiating the Olympus Pro applications.\nWork with Olympus to integrate a sorting mechanism that allows for sorting the Pro applications based on a set of parameters.\nEnable $OHM holders to signal their preference over the Pro applicants whitelisted by Olympus.\nOlympus <> Prime Launch\n\nEnable $OHM\/$gOHM into shortcut assets for DAOs to choose which asset to raise funds with.\nOnboard Olympus into Prime Launch\u2019s seed module, whereby Launch facilitates the transactions with the incubated partners.\nOnboard Olympus and their incubated projects to Prime Launch for launching their projects.\nSynchronize Prime Launch\u2019s selection process of onboarding DAOs into the seed module with applying to Olympus\u2019 Incubation program as sequential phases of building up to the launch.\nOlympus <> Proposal Inverter\n\nWork with the Olympus team to integrate Tyche with Proposal Inverter so that the Olympus community can coordinate around which initiatives to direct fundings to\nEnable a novel method of funding public goods for the Olympus community and benefit from potential retroactive airdrops.\nSupport Building up to the Prime Token Launch\n\nIntroduction to the Olympus Community\nAdvice and assistance when needed from the Olympus team\nBootstrapping Liquidity for D2D\n\nUse of Olympus\u2019 upcoming liquidity products to bootstrap our initial liquidity.\nUse of Olympus Pro to be able to own our liquidity.\nOnboarding $OHM into the Balancer Ecosystem\n\nAs a partner of both BalancerDAO and OlympusDAO, PrimeDAO will play an active role in bridging liquidity between the two protocols.\nBuilding a deep liquidity between D2D <> OHM <> BAL to allow LBPs to be able to select OHM as an efficient bootstrap asset and open up additional LaaS opportunities.\nConclusion\nOur partnership will set the stage for a strong collaboration between Olympus and Prime as we work towards becoming the primary coordination stream for DAOs. OHM wants to be the liquidity bridge\/backend of the whole ecosystem. Olympus can utilize PrimeDAO as a coordination vehicle in calling a DeFi alliance and to strengthen the plasticity of ecosystem liquidity. By partnering with PrimeDAO, Olympus will be a leading voice in the creation of DAO2DAO products that enhance its offering and deal making mechanics, while supporting PrimeDAO\u2019s push towards becoming a DAO co-habitation space.","protocol":"primedao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x58Ff691f7849b0666085CFb693568160Cfb9d22D","totalVotes":13,"blockNumber":13759275,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/primexyz.eth\/proposal\/QmccmHEfehthqoM8VvPvVgPq8ZeA1taZRPKbotws1c6XXW","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638896420}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639069227}","startTimestamp":1638896420,"endTimestamp":1639069227,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, accept the proposal!', 'No, do not accept the proposal.']","results":"[{'total': 2937.15, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

With PrimeDAOs relaunch, it seeks to further commit to the building on the Balancer Protocol and supporting the decentralization and development of the BalancerDAO.\n\nThe current Prime product suits, consisting of Prime Launch (LBP interface), Prime Rating (research sub-DAO), Prime Pools (DAO governed Balancer Pools) and Prime Deals (Interface for DAO agreements) aim to provide substantial value to BalancerDAO and aligned DAOs.\n\nBackground on the Partnership\nThe relationship between BalancerDAO and PrimeDAO goes back to Q4 2020. Since the launch of PrimeDAO in November 2020, the Balancer protocol has played a crucial role in the PRIME ecosystem. Initially coined the Prime LP Manager, PrimeDAO has governed all parameters of its main liquidity pool on Balancer, existing of 20% ETH and 80% PRIME via the PrimeDAO\u2019s initial governance mechanism (Alchemy by DAOstack).\n\nIn Q1 2021, PrimeDAO set out to revamp the LBP experience for users and project teams alike after an uncomfortable experience with another launch product. Through a grant from Balancer Labs, the development of what is known as Prime Launch started. Prime Launch allows anyone to bootstrap a token without needing to write a single line of code. The product provides a crisp and user-friendly interface, support, and ecosystem of service providers that will enable the best decentralized launch experience (going live on December 13th, 2021).\n\nWith the development of Prime Launch, PrimeDAO became a Balancer v2 launching partner, and the collaboration extended to active technical and organizational development. In Q2 2021, Balancer and PrimeDAO made headlines by starting BLxPR, the first DAO2DAO pool, a shared liquidity pool between Balancer and PrimeDAO.\n\nSince then, the teams have continued to work together, and various PrimeDAO contributors have supported the development of BalancerDAO and the Balancer Protocol.\n\nAfter successfully re-branding and raising seed funds, PrimeDAO has grown to over 30 full-time contributors and is ready to launch its product suite and solidify relationships with aligned DAOs. Some of the DAO that have recently partnered include DeFI Safety and Gitcoin.\n\nCommitment of the Organizations\nBoth parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnerships:\n\nD2D Collaboration\n\nPrimeDAO\u2019s primary aim is enabling D2D collaborations and shares this vision with Balancer. PrimeDAO will support the development of the BalancerDAO and, where possible, share learnings and resources with BalancerDAO.\nBalancerDAO will get early access to Prime Deals , an Interface for DAO to DAO interactions, such as token swaps co-liquidity provision, and joint venture formation, to give input, to ensure the product serves the needs of BalancerDAO.\nTechnical\n\nPrimeDAO will continue to host Balancer LBP through Prime Launch and support the development of LBPs on Balancer.\nPrimeDAOs builders will continue to support the development of the Balancer Protocol.\nPrimeDAOs will support the development of the Balancer Protocol on alternative blockchains, currently evaluating the deployment of Balancer V2.0 on Celo and xDAI chain in collaboration with Symmetric, with the potential for it to develop into a Balancer Friendly Fork.\nOperational\n\nBoth DAOs will actively share DAO operational learnings and workflows, starting with a bi-monthly knowledge-sharing session covering three topics relevant to both DAOs. The first session will be organized in mid-January.\nMarketing\n\nTo ensure both entities will profit from each other\u2019s reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where applicable.\nCo-liquidity provision:\n\nTo align governance interests, between the two organizations, the creation of a co-liquidity pool is proposed with the following details; 25,000 BAL from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund would be transferred to PrimeDAO at the end of PrimeDAO own LBP to bootstrap a PRIME \/ BAL pool with 50\/50 weights and 2,5% trading fees. Right after the conclusion of the PRIME LBP, PrimeDAO will seed a pool with the 25,000 BAL and match it with the same $ value in Prime. Once the pool is initiated, PrimeDAO will transfer 50% of the Balancer Pool Tokens to the Balancer Ecosystem Fund to complete the transaction.\nThe pool will again be called the Balancer <> PRIME pool (BLxPR) and function as a liquidity bridge between the two DAOs. The BLxPR pool will be one of the two main liquidity pools for PrimeDAO.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe BLxPR token will be added to the Snapshot strategies of both DAOs to allow BLxPR token holders to participate in the Governance of both protocols.\nA new snapshot will be set-up with the BLxPR as the governing token. This snapshot will be used to govern issues related to this DAO agreement.\nPool Optimization\n\nPrimeDAO aims to create deep liquidity between BAL <> PRIME to be able to bring more projects and liquidity to the Balancer Protocol. PrimeDAO aims to do this by actively engaging in D2D agreement with other DAOs and creating PRIME \/ xxx pools on the Balancer Protocol .\nPrimeDAO also aims to leverage the various upcoming Balancer Pools in combination with PrimeDAOs existing products. Prime Rating could potentially be utilized to create research-driven managed pools and Prime Deals could be connected to the Balancer Protocol to allow multiple DAOs to bootstrap a pool together in a completely permissionless way.","protocol":"primedao","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x58Ff691f7849b0666085CFb693568160Cfb9d22D","totalVotes":13,"blockNumber":13759238,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/primexyz.eth\/proposal\/QmfTWqtpq64baqKkrCxgFsbT5Aji5Y7QTqFDnh5DqtKnQH","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638896404}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639069225}","startTimestamp":1638896404,"endTimestamp":1639069225,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, accept the proposal!', 'No, do not accept the proposal.']","results":"[{'total': 2937.15, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

While we are building these DAO2DAO products and services, we are paving the way for these interactions by dogfooding PrimeDAO itself into a headless brand\u2014 an open value network that builds effective organizational coordination tools to secure the collective future of DAOs all over the world.\n\nWe want to establish PrimeDAO as a hub for DAOs to come together and co-build DAO toolings and services.

All five projects share the common connection of being built on, developing or supporting the $RLY protocol. \n\nEach of the projects will have its own budget (totaling $86M USDC \/ 345M $RLY), and in the case of SuperLayer Labs, the $RLY community will additionally have an investment opportunity ($25M USDC) and provide a credit facility ($20M USDC).  Governance structures designed for each project will enable their success.  Full details of the proposal can be found in this forum post (https:\/\/forum.rally.io\/t\/proposal-rly-network-decentralization\/1240\/35).\n\nDETAILS\nAs a first step, the non-profit $RLY Network Association will be launched to build and maintain the core blockchain technology, oversee network protocols and rewards, and oversee the $RLY community treasury. Rally.io and the forthcoming Rally Asia Project (a similar project to Rally.io serving the Asian Creator market - name TBD) will be region-specific creator monetization projects that will provide a blueprint for further global creator-focused expansion. Additionally, a venture studio called SuperLayer Labs aimed at supporting the launch of new tokenized consumer products leveraging the $RLY protocol will be unveiled soon. And finally, we propose creating a $RLY Ecosystem DAO, which will be directly run and governed by the $RLY community, that can disburse grants or loans from community funding of the DAO and oversee projects for the broader ecosystem. \n\nWith this new set of decentralized infrastructure in place, the $RLY protocol should become even more attractive for third-party developers, creators, or anyone to build a business on the $RLY protocol without any singular centralized entity or party controlling the ecosystem.\n\nSummary budget (detailed breakdown and release schedule located in forum post):\nRally.io - 150M $RLY and 60M $USDC\nRally Asia - 70M $RLY and 17.5M $USDC\n$RLY Network - 55M $RLY and 6.5M $USDC\n$RLY Ecosystem DAO - 20M $RLY and 2M $USDC\nSuperLayer - 50M $RLY, 20M $USDC credit facility, and opportunity for community to invest up to 25M $USDC in new venture investments that SuperLayer leads\n\n*Note: The 20M $USDC credit facility to SuperLayer is at a five percent (5%) annual interest rate payable annually with a loan term of thirty-six (36) months from the date of tranche draw. \n\nRELEASE SCHEDULE, VOLUME RESTRICTIONS, and REPORTING: \nThe first tranche of funding for each entity will be released within five (5) days of approval of this proposal.  Prior to the approval of the second tranche, Rally.io and Rally Asia will submit their own clear and measurable milestones and\/or KPIs to the $RLY Network Association. The milestones and\/or KPIs will be quarterly measurables that will be considered for subsequent funding requests in tranches three to five. The release schedule is detailed in the forum post.  \n\nThe granted $RLY will be subject to transfer volume restrictions as determined and set by the $RLY Network Association. A recommendation to the Association will be for all $RLY distributed under the Decentralization proposal to be subject to the below volume restrictions:\n\n*Daily Volume Liquidation Limit by Category:\nVendors - Up to USD$10,000 worth of $RLY\nProject - Up to USD$10,000 worth of $RLY\n\n*Daily volume liquidation limit calculations to use the day\u2019s opening rate based on https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/currencies\/rally\/historical-data\/.  \n\nAdherence to volume restrictions will be monitored by the $RLY Network Association.  Any deviation from such restrictions will result in action by the Association.\n\nEach of the Rally.io and Rally Asia projects will provide quarterly reporting on spend and results based on guidelines provided by the $RLY Network Association. Further, each project will provide monthly volume trade activity to the $RLY Network Association to demonstrate compliance with the volume restrictions.\n\n\nA YES vote for this proposal would approve the decentralization plan and associated budgets to be distributed by the Community Treasury Manager per the tranche schedule detailed in the forum post. \n\nA NO vote will reject the decentralization plan. \n","protocol":"rally","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x893D2E776F21143354123241bC1DC237C47BC3fC","totalVotes":36,"blockNumber":13082642,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rallygov.eth\/proposal\/QmetgBJNuP8pRU5btJYQn1zuE5SaNYFB1bbmc8HBLs8KSJ","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1629737100}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1629909900}","startTimestamp":1629737100,"endTimestamp":1629909900,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 10546.517, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

The newly proposed (or \u201cexpanded\u201d) curve, had updated token supply, slope, and vesting requirements for creator genesis coins.\n\nAfter seeing the performance of the coins launched on the expanded curve over the last few weeks, we believe an update is necessary to the creator genesis coin vesting requirements. The current vesting schedule tends to be too restrictive and does not give the creator a large enough % ownership in their economy, flexibility with free token distribution or stake in potential community activity rewards.\n\nThis proposal recommends the below update to the creator genesis coin vesting schedule. If approved, this vesting schedule change would apply to new creators launched on the expanded curve as well as retroactively to existing creators already on it.\n\n**New Proposed Updated Vesting Schedule for Creator Genesis Coin:**\n - 50k creator coins unlock immediately\n - Additional 3% of supply unlocks each month through end of year 3\n - Vesting begins immediately, no 6 month cliff\n - All coins unlocked in the genesis supply will be subject to flow controls\n - Vesting will also be capped so a creator won\u2019t vest more than 30% of the total circulating supply at any point (i.e. in order to unlock all 5MM coins in the genesis supply, creator must garner enough support for 16.7MM+ coins in circulation.)\n\n**Forum post for reference:**\n \nhttps:\/\/forum.rally.io\/t\/proposal-expanded-tbc-vesting-schedule\/1190\n\n**Proposal**\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would approve the updates to the vesting schedule as outlined above.\n\nA No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.\n\n","protocol":"rally","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389","totalVotes":8,"blockNumber":13001920,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rallygov.eth\/proposal\/QmQRwNqZWNiKHPrzDeqFJtUEF3HVAM8S2xCa74odnxa32C","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1628658000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1628830800}","startTimestamp":1628658000,"endTimestamp":1628830800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 1865.1458, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 366.22992, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Key areas of focus include:\n - Monitoring and Alerting\n - Load and Stress Testing\n - DevOps Consulting\n - Economic Alerting & Monitoring\n - Anti botting \/ Fraud detection\n - Mobile Application(s)\n\nPlease review the Discourse forum discussion for full details, a breakdown of the total budget, and an in-depth community discussion: https:\/\/forum.rally.io\/t\/proposal-rally-infrastructure-engineering-funding-request\/1114\n \n**Summary\/Abstract:**\nThe budget requested would be to cover a 12 month period for the following areas:\n\nMonitoring and Alerting: This proposal recommends engaging DataDog, currently in use on a trial basis. Funding will enable additional instrumentation to enable improvement of code and infrastructure and to provide insight into Rally systems without major engineering work.  Requested budget required for this tool: $144,000 (12 months)\n\nLoad and Stress Testing: This funding will enable build\/outsource of a comprehensive suite of load\/stress tests to discover bottlenecks and ensure various parts of the Rally infrastructure system can handle load end to end.  Requested budget required for such tools: $180,000 (12 months)\n\nDevOps Consulting: Foghorn consulting (specifically FogOps) is recommended to supplement existing DevOps engineering efforts to audit Rally systems for security and performance and ensure Rally is using the latest technologies and best practices.  Requested budget required for this tool: $288,000 (12 months)\n\nEconomic Alerting and Monitoring: This spend is recommended for economic alerting and monitoring of value fluctuations and calculations. Quantiphi is an AWS partner that could help with Data Engineering and AI\/ML and help set up the data infrastructure.  Requested budget required for this engagement: $432,000 (12 months)\n\nAnti botting \/ Fraud detection: Addressing bots and fraud is a high priority for Rally and the community. Investing in the right tools can help detect or mitigate against use of bots to commit fraud, and fraud detection tools can help detect and prevent bad behavior and not allow a few bad actors to affect the entire community.  Requested budget required for such tools: $180,000 (12 months)\n\nMobile Application(s): Developing mobile apps would help the spread the use and adoption of Rally and help with MFA, providing more security within the Rally ecosystem.  Certain use cases for creator coins can be a separate app, or an app that allows creators to white label their own apps to manage their own coins\/ NFTs within their community.

Taking into consideration the lack of a DAO organization to run administrative duties, this proposal adds a 6 month vesting period that is easy to administer and mitigates (mildly) some of the issues discussed.\n\nThis proposal vote does not approve a proper RallyDAO, but instead will kick off work aligned with other progressive decentralization work the initial development team is working on. The RallyDAO would empower the community further to set these matters with more effective governance tools that have come to market since the Rally launch.\n\nWe look forward to RLY token holders' vote on this matter.\n\n\n","protocol":"rally","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x36aaf8A503B145F90F71C93F901049359b880Abc","totalVotes":11,"blockNumber":12781398,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rallygov.eth\/proposal\/QmdFtQHXvLCmrmbT1mrCx96ASdsn3VAdSwTHrfv65G4VHQ","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1625702400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1625961600}","startTimestamp":1625702400,"endTimestamp":1625961600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 1830.8401, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

It will bring more focus to Rally creators, drive market education about creator coins, enlist increased support for creator coin economics from brands, and drive attention from mainstream media. It will be a building block to support other efforts already underway by the Rally marketing team and the recently approved liquidity program. Finally, it will be led by a Rally community member and help directly impact metrics important to the network such as new creator recruitment, creator success, and the rapid scaling of market awareness and consumer participation.\n\nThis proposal has been discussed at length in the forum. For the full discussion, please review the Discourse forum posts here: https:\/\/forum.rally.io\/t\/proposal-new-media-opportunity-that-can-help-grow-the-rally-creator-and-social-token-economy\/1018\n\n\n**Background**\nBret Kinsella is the creator of $BOT Coin which grew out of his work founding Voicebot.ai and Voicebot Research. Those organizations established the central source for data, news, and analysis for the growing voice AI community in 2016. They served to educate the market and bring together entrepreneurs, tech giants, and consumer brands to grow the industry collaboratively. Several Rally creators recognized that a similar solution could benefit the creator economy in general and the Rally Network and Rally creators in particular. \n\nThe project will consist of an online publication, podcast, and research organization that will cultivate audiences among creators, consumer brand marketers, and other news media. This is not a $BOT Coin project but instead is designed to support all Rally creators and the network as a whole. \n\nThe new organization will not be limited to covering Rally as it will be important to draw a larger audience that is generally interested in the business and technology of the creator economy. This will give the areas of focus around Rally greater reach. However, the proposed funding from Rally is requested to accelerate the program and build out the Rally-specific elements so the impact can be generated sooner. \n\n**The Rally community is expected to benefit in several ways from this initiative:**\n- Generate more awareness for Rally creators among brands and other organizations with budgets for influencer marketing campaigns that could be integrated with creator coin projects\n- Generate more awareness for Rally creators among media by providing a platform for independent exposure through a specialist media and research organization that backs analysis with concrete data\n- Provide an independent source of information about Rally that can help educate businesses, media, and others\n- Provide resources for creators to help them better manage and add value to their coin economies\n- Raise awareness among creators that Rally is an attractive option for building their businesses and enlisting them before they choose alternative social token solution\n \nBret Kinsella and his organization EdgeLens LLC are particularly well suited to deliver these benefits because of their experience building Voicebot.ai, past experience hiring and collaborating with dozens of creators\/influencers, and in-depth knowledge of Rally. If approved, the project will begin in June 2021. More details are provided in the forum discussion. \n\n**Metrics**\nTo provide visibility to the Rally community, EdgeLens will publish summary metrics and activities in the Rally Discord on at least a quarterly basis related to growth, Rally-related resources, and Rally exposure. Bret Kinsella will also host an online discussion after the first three months to discuss the project and field questions from the community.  \n\n**Proposal**\nThis proposal will grant EdgeLens LLC 16k $RLY per month for six months from the Community Treasury to develop the project described above. \n\n**A Yes vote for this proposal would approve the payment of this grant. A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.**\n","protocol":"rally","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xa8672C3cef0dCe305102f20AC820c921c91fF7e2","totalVotes":11,"blockNumber":12556521,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rallygov.eth\/proposal\/QmU4L8Ro3hJZpS6XsLDPVWpjNuByHYQz2MVGNicmbkCSZ3","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1622656800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1622829600}","startTimestamp":1622656800,"endTimestamp":1622829600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES', 'NO']","results":"[{'total': 1489.9415, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

The platform's infrastructure only allows for donations and doesn't give creators the power to monetize their content.\n\nRally creators are often faced with a challenge: convincing their fans (who are often not as well versed in the crypto space) to pay cash for a digital coin when most other creators offer them physical goods (merch, limited edition items, etc).\n\n**The Solution**\n\nGating Clubhouse rooms with creator coins. This lets creators monetize their rooms and incentivizes fans to buy their coins and hold them over a long time frame.\n\n**An Example**\n\n-   Jeremiah Owyang (JOW) creates a room with [paidrooms.ch 3](http:\/\/paidrooms.ch\/). The topic is \"Come pitch your startups\" - he'll offer feedback on startup pitches and will potentially keep in touch with the founders if he hears a good pitch.\n\n-   He sets the minimum number of coins held to join the room to 10.\n\n-   Founders who see the asymmetric upside in attending his room buy 10 coins and sign up.\n\n-   The founders who attended can choose to sell their coins afterward, but recognize that Jeremiah will be hosting more gated rooms in the future and since they gained a ton of value from the session, will hold onto them.\n\nSince the rooms are gated, fewer people attend overall compared to average rooms, which makes the setting more intimate. Often there are journalists or unwelcomed guests in public rooms, but with gated ones, the host knows that each attendee is one of their supporters, so they are more open and authentic in conversation.\n\n**Initial Stats**\n\nHere are a few stats so far:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Views (home) = 5986\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rooms started = 231 (room info was filled out but the user did not sign up)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rooms created = 56 (user signed up and the room was created successfully)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rooms that went live = 17\n\nWe're hoping that with a bit of funding and support from the Rally community, we can get this in the hands of more creators.\n\n**Future Plans**\n\nWe want to help creators understand their core audience and engage with their top supporters. The platform currently lets creators make rooms, track payments, send their attendees SMS messages, and partner with co-hosts. We plan on building out more Rally functionality within the platform, like being able to purchase rooms with creator coins and give live donations. We also plan on building out a robust set of analytics so that creators can track their top supporters and the rooms that are most engaging. With enough data from different types of creators, we can start making automated suggestions on room types and their pricing.\n\n**Funding**\n\n-   The cost of hosting the platform is ~$130\/mo\n\n-   The cost of paying our engineer is ~$50\/hr. With big changes being made to the platform over the next month he will be working ~130hrs. Those updates include adding the ability to purchase access to a room with creator coins (as opposed to how gating functions currently with a minimum required coin count) and implementing the ability for audience members to give donations and get rewards live (i.e being brought up to the stage).\n\n-   Afterward, we would just do maintenance and update the platform based on feedback from Rally creators. This would be in the ball-park of ~40hrs of engineering work for the month.\n\n**Total cost for the next two months = 130x2 + 50x120 + 50x40 = $8760 in RLY**\n\nThese next two months will be a recursive process of approximating PMF with the help of feedback from creators. We will be closely monitoring their usage and any friction points they experience while using the platform. We will also be getting input on which additions would be most useful to implement (i.e. room analytics, RLY donation sounds, etc).\n\n**The Impact on Rally**\n\nThere are 26 active Rally creators Clubhouse. Many of them own large clubs or are influential members of large clubs (Wellness Club (19.4K), Talk Club (139K), Human Behaviour (503K), Womxn in Business Club (320K), Startup Club (481K), Cash in your story (25.4K), etc).\n\nLet's assume each creator hosts 1 room per week and each room gets an average of 100 attendees.\n\nLet's also assume 10% of their audience would engage with gated rooms.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a026 creators * 8 weeks * 10 attendees = 2080 attendees\n\nLet's also assume that on average, attendees must buy 10 coins to join these rooms.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02080 attendees * 10 coins = 20800 coins\n\nBased on today's coin prices, the average creator coin for these 26 creators is ~$5.50.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a020800 coins * $5.50 = $114400\n\nWe also believe that the network effects of introducing 2080 people to Rally could be much larger, as they might be inclined to purchase coins from other creators on the platform or tell their friends about Rally.

The Discourse forum discussion noted above explains in greater detail the reasons why liquidity is necessary, which types of partners we\u2019ll need to engage to grow liquidity, in which capacity we will engage those partners, how we\u2019ll measure success, and lastly, the budget necessary to be successful.\n\nTo properly engage with the partners, and progress the metrics, outlined in the Discourse discussion, a very high-level budget request for the following 12 months is outlined below, consisting of up to a maximum total of 35M $RLY, to be deployed as follows:\n\n Loans: $RLY deployed in the form of loans to centralized exchange market maker partners enable these key market players to provide consistent two sided markets.\n - Amount of allocation: 60-70% of total budget\n - Loans may contain embedded options to sell $RLY\n - Loan terms to be no longer than 12 months\n\nEducation\/Marketing: $RLY deployed to exchange-specific education and marketing programs relating to the token are generally required by key exchanges. \n - Amount of allocation: 30-40% of total budget\n - $RLY will be returned to community if not used\n\nMost of the budget is composed of loans which will be repaid either in $RLY or USD depending on the terms required by the relevant partners, and the educational\/marketing spend will be returned if initiatives are not executed or are unsuccessful. \n\n**Proposal for review**\nThis proposal, if passed, will effectuate the following actions:\n\n**1. Approve $RLY Allocation**\nApprove up to a maximum total of 35M $RLY, to be deployed in the form of Loans and Education\/Marketing initiatives as outlined above.  All loaned $RLY (or equivalent value) will be returned to the community, and all unused\/unsuccessful education and marketing funds will likewise be returned.\n\n**2. Community Oversight and Governance**\nAdopt the following structure for community oversight and governance of this spend:\n - Quarterly report delivered to the community at the end of each calendar quarter (end of June and September, 2021)\n - Quarterly community calls to review the report and collect community feedback on progress, spend, and strategy.\n\n**3. Appoint Community Agent**\nMiguel Vias is appointed to act as the Rally community\u2019s agent for purposes of identifying and vetting partners, vendors and exchanges, and overseeing and managing relationships with selected partners, vendors and exchanges.  As the community\u2019s agent, he will be authorized to sign necessary contracts and documentation on behalf of the community, and if appropriate and necessary, to appoint an appropriate legal entity\/counterparty to sign necessary documentation on behalf of the Rally community.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n**A Yes vote would approve the proposal outlined above, based on the rationale outlined in this proposal and the associated Discourse discussion.**\n\n**A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.**\n","protocol":"rally","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xADdC94AD74251792E52A4851591665ea0E8f7389","totalVotes":15,"blockNumber":12495030,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rallygov.eth\/proposal\/QmZLFXPwN6GuDHm5rHPMULtZkzr9cL3Hj7oMuEhxV84uPD","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1621832400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1622005200}","startTimestamp":1621832400,"endTimestamp":1622005200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 3625.1223, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

We handpick the most up to date information and create content that is suitable and engaging to read.\n\nOur goal is to make GameFi a better place by making it accessible and educate everyone who is interested to make more informed decisions. We also want to collaborate with sponsors who believe in our development and positive future outcomes for everyone including the community, sponsors who partner up with us and GameFi Corner itself.\n\nWe see success when partnerships can truly benefit from one another like an interconnected chain. One provides with the sponsor, funding and in return we will contribute all our specific GameFi knowledge through extensive research and investment in paid advertisements so we can create traffic for both Rari Capital and GameFi Corner.\n\nWe will measure our success by analysing on how many users have clicked on your link \/ banner we will include in our texts. The more subscribers we can bring thanks to your potential funding, the more successful we will both become.

This is Prometheus, Co-Founder and Strategy Lead at Hector DAO.\n\nAfter agreeing a deal with the Rari Capital team, confirming the deal in a Hector DAO community vote, and finalising details, it is now my honour to seek the blessing of the Rari community in a final vote to implement our proposal.\n\nThe terms of the proposal are listed at the bottom of this post.\n\nThe following is excerpted and adapted from our original post on the Rari forums: https:\/\/forums.rari.capital\/d\/188-deploying-fuse-on-the-fantom-opera-chain-with-hector-dao\n\nI've removed a few paragraphs here to keep it concise. I recommend reading the original post in full.\n\nHector DAO is the largest rebase protocol on the Fantom network. Our market capitalisation is approximately $112,000,000, and we have $192,000,000 of value locked in our protocol. Here is a link to our DeFiLlama profile: https:\/\/defillama.com\/protocol\/hector-dao\n\nIn the month of November, we were the most traded project on the Fantom network, with a volume of $612,000,000, surpassing even SpookySwap - one of the main decentralised exchanges of the network. We employ a full-time team of 10+ developers and strategists which allows us to develop our project faster than any competitor on the chain.\n\nHector will integrate an open interest rate protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets, all within the Hector Ecosystem. Lenders can achieve an attractive APY without any risk of volatility of the HEC price by lending out stable coins. Borrowers can use sHEC as a collateral to leverage their position or borrow stablecoins to use them in different projects without having to unstake sHEC. The benefit for the protocol is that the treasury collects fees, consisting of the difference between APR for borrowers and APY for lenders. This way, the treasury increases, which in return has a positive impact on Hector\u2019s APY. The Lending and borrowing protocol will come with it\u2019s own UI.\n\nCreating positive, impactful partnerships and relationships such as this are at the forefront of our priorities - cooperation is good for everyone. We want to contribute to the growth of the Fantom network. We focus on long-term growth and it is our stated aim to bring value to our users and investors in a reliable, responsible way. We aim to become a de facto financial centre within the Fantom chain.\n\nWe believe that future cooperation between Rari Capital and Hector is mutually beneficial and will align with the goals of both parties in a meaningful way.\n\nPrometheus,\nStrategy lead at Team HECDAO.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\nThe terms agreed upon between the Rari Capital and Hector DAO Teams are as follows:\n- $500,000 in HEC tokens to be vested to Rari Capital. The vesting schedule will monthly for a total of 6 months.\n- 30% of revenue from products on Hector Bank which use Fuse technologies to be given to Rari Capital\n\nIn exchange, Hector DAO will receive access to and support with the required Fuse contracts in order to develop part of the Hector Bank solution.\n\n","protocol":"rari","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x634F5c1f72c74Aa5CE38d6c84B9Bb43FA5cA3cE3","totalVotes":6,"blockNumber":13777562,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rari\/proposal\/0x9209f187f2a696cd777d168d3fc70c4dd7becb3be0f4465bed92355ed3d5570e","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639143000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639245600}","startTimestamp":1639143000,"endTimestamp":1639245600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 544.8762, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Take the case in which these options receive 10%, 40%, and 50% of the votes respectively; the final payout would be calculated as 0.1A + 0.4B + 0.5*C.\n\nThis vote will be posted to both the TRIBE and RARI snapshots. The votes on both snapshots will be totaled to compute the numbers and proportions above, using the conversion factor of 1 RGT = 26.7056734303 TRIBE listed in the terms of the merger. This is important so that both TRIBE and RARI holders can have say on the size of the payment.\n\nIf the \u201cNo Payment\u201d option receives more than 50% of the vote, then no payment will be given. Otherwise, \u201cNo Payment\u201d is equivalent to \u201c0\u201d.\n\nScope and Execution\n\nPayment will be in FEI remitted from the Tribe Optimistic Approval multisig and is intended to be compensation for existing, completed work, and is not meant to be an indication of future collaboration. All additional compensation or long term arrangements between GFX and TRIBE are separate from this proposal.\n\nLinks\n\nAssociated Tribe Forum Post:\nhttps:\/\/tribe.fei.money\/t\/fip-xx-amended-fei-rari-merger-proposal-fip-xx-gfx-labs-compensation\/3734\n\nAssociated Rari Forum Post:\nhttps:\/\/forums.rari.capital\/d\/186-amended-feirari-merger-proposal-gfx-labs-compensation\n\nOriginal GFX Labs Merger Proposal: https:\/\/gfxlabs.io\/docs\/draft_fei_rari_merger.pdf\n\nOriginal GFX Labs Smart Contract Code:\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/code-423n4\/2021-11-fei","protocol":"rari","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x2cfBF3D40F71ceed2997cACbafE9D31e630860CB","totalVotes":13,"blockNumber":13729077,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rari\/proposal\/0x6d0f619b4c4aa07f26683e7965aad3a2f6da4592e10809b0d3f6df4e5fcdee4d","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638471600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1638817200}","startTimestamp":1638471600,"endTimestamp":1638817200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['No Payment', '50k FEI', '100k FEI', '333k FEI', '1M FEI', '2M FEI', '3.5M FEI']","results":"[{'total': 1156.4819, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 35, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 99689.79, 'choice': 3}]","events":"[]"}

Over the last nearly 12 months, a really strong community has formed (see discord\u00a0https:\/\/discord.gg\/us2qCtrY ), and progress is increasing by the week. The goal of this community is to increase the adoption of the Rarible Protocol, as well as return value to RARI holders in other ways such as distributing grants to other projects, and building NFT projects in-house.\n\nHowever, there is currently very little community representation of this community at a governance level. Almost every person in the DAO who has been paid in RARI has had to convert their RARI to fiat eventually (people need to eat!).\n\nThis proposal is asking for 20K RARI in order to give our community a voice at the governance level. 100% of these tokens will be kept in a \u2157 Multisig, controlled by the following community members:\n\n- Eric Arsenault\n- Ezra Weller\n- Sarmad Ahmad\n- Maria Sanchez\n- Brandon Valosek\n\nOver time, we are expecting that key contributors to the community will own a share of governance tokens in order to align incentives and ensure we retain talent. Once this program is created and approved by the DAO, 100% of these funds will be returned to the parent Rarible DAO. These funds are an interim solution to give our community a voice, and allow us to move more quickly.\n\nThe community will use our own internal governance process to determine if we should support proposals that are proposed to Rarible DAO, and execute according to the wishes of this community.\n\nIn addition, we this proposal would also allocate 20K RARI to Alex and to Alexei (interestingly enough, they also don\u2019t have representation in the DAO!) - these funds will also be returned to the parent DAO once tokens are issued to stakeholders.\n\nGiving Alex \/ Alexei governance power will have an additional benefit of allowing us to put all proposals up for vote. Currently, there is a certain bottleneck around proposals, with me (Eric), being the middleman trying to block proposals that they might not support.

Our current treasury is down to ~$25k and are proactively seeking additional funding. Active members of the Ops WG include Eric, Noah, Mark, and Sarmad.

These funds will be used to:\n\n- Pay current workers for their contributions to onboarding, reporting, treasury management, and overall efficiency\n- Hire new ops related roles as necessary\n- Fund any additional subscriptions managing documentation, email, and other important business tools\n- Fund travel and working related expenses\n- Continue to sponsor hackathon events\n- We expect these funds will last a number of months (>3)\n\n### Accountability\n\nThe working group will be completely transparent around how funds are used, and provide reports at the end of each month outlining expenses. Reporting for September will be issed at next community call October 7th, 2021.\n\nMembers of the working group will continue attending community calls and will participate in governance processes.\n\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nWe need to keep pushing forward with the execution of a decentralized ecosystem.

This would ensure the possibility of having a restricted collection.\n\n**Problem \/ Opportunity**\nThe current contracts let everyone mint NFTs. Some projects require restricting this feature to specific users, but it is currently impossible. This directly impacts the quality of NFTs listed on the platform.\n\nThis is also a blocking requirement for my company Liteflow. Some of the platforms we are discussing expect to restrict the minting process to admin, partners, or specific users.\n\nThis issue seems to be a problem for other Rarible users, as you can see in this discussion I\u2019ve initiated on Github:\n\n[GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/rarible\/protocol-issues\/discussions\/11)\n**[Restrict addresses allowed to mint \u00b7 Discussion #11 \u00b7 rarible\/protocol-issues](https:\/\/github.com\/rarible\/protocol-issues\/discussions\/11)**\n\n![https:\/\/gov.rarible.org\/uploads\/default\/optimized\/1X\/7084b8390c758d8a4def407f75253a6d389403b7_2_690x345.png](https:\/\/gov.rarible.org\/uploads\/default\/optimized\/1X\/7084b8390c758d8a4def407f75253a6d389403b7_2_690x345.png)\n\nThanks to the current smart contract architecture, once this feature is finalized, all the existing collections will be able to opt-in for it, so it will be required not to have any breaking change.\n\n**Funding Milestones and Payments**\nMilestones & payments:\n\nPhase 1: Analyse smart contracts - 1 day\nPhase 2: Add mint restriction (while still preserving the default option to be public) - 3 days\nPhase 3: Add support for off-chain authorization - 3 days\nPhase 4: Update of the documentation related to these changes - 1 day\nTotal days of work: 8 days\n\nPrice: $12,000\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address: 0x34EE3a64eab0D2Ae5d447e1fF94Ab6cf8136Fbce\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly.

Our customers expect a Rarible-like platform but customized to their own needs. We also provide development services for blockchain projects, more details on https:\/\/liteflow.com\/.\n\n**Team Members**\nAnthony Estebe: antho1404 (Anthony) \u00b7 GitHub\nNicolas Mah\u00e9: NicolasMahe (Nicolas Mahe) \u00b7 GitHub\nThe contact person for this project is Anthony Estebe. The contact information is anthony@liteflow.com, and the Discord handle is antho1404 | Liteflow#2211\n\nHow long has your team worked together? What other projects have you worked on?\n\nOur team has worked on Liteflow for the past 2 years. During this time, we worked on various blockchain projects like NFTs, real-time monitoring of blockchain apps and transactions, and blockchain automation. Before that, the core team worked for 3 years on a custom blockchain for decentralized executions MESG.\n\n**Accountability**\nLiteflow will participate in discussions in Discord and Github. The work will be pushed on Github and can be verified and accepted by the Rarible team.\n\nWhy should Rarible DAO fund this?\nWe believe this feature is required for many NFT projects. Once implemented, it will help the acquisition of the Rarible protocol by projects that want to create restricted collections.\n\n**Useful Links & Media**\n[Liteflow company](https:\/\/liteflow.com\/)\n\n[Liteflow white-labeled NFT Marketplace](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1VAkDTFgHjCKR6OXscrXA-j9t3ttztk3a\/view)","protocol":"rarible","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x70b71b98c8b95643462C68e0A396d0a6d15337bf","totalVotes":85,"blockNumber":13260305,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rarible.eth\/proposal\/QmSE9CiQ1CtZpdiRsHsMq33HtWrP9cm47eVH9LXTXxoAHt","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1632146400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1632578400}","startTimestamp":1632146400,"endTimestamp":1632578400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Vote FOR', 'Vote AGAINST']","results":"[{'total': 11322.956, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 414.98502, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This includes constraints on 25% of the current treasury balance.\n\n**Details**\n\nWe are continuing to grow the DAO through new hires, working groups, and grants. In order to have continued success and growth, it is vital that Rarible DAO practices treasury management. Currently the treasury is primarily RARI tokens. A strong and autonomous treasury will allow us to withstand any sudden changes in the market and prolonged periods of volatility. Our goal is to preserve and grow assets while attracting new talent and teams regardless of market conditions. We will look to achieve our goals by adopting a risk averse strategy and bolstering our treasury through diversification. We will not make any changes to 25% of the current balance without further approvals from the DAO. We will consider new strategies that will offer flexibility, liquidity, and security. We are intent on ensuring the DAO has sufficient runway in case of a downturn or another cryptowinter. Due to the nature of treasury, some transactions are time sensitive and require initial privacy. Having a treasury committee will also allow us to respond quickly to market conditions.\n\n**Team**\n\nTreasury functions are currently handled by Alex Salnikov, Eric Arsenault, and Noah Kramer. We will look to expanded the team as needed.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nWe will be transparent around how funds are used by providing monthly reports that outline our current holdings.\n\nMembers of the Treasury committee will continue to be active participants in governance and community calls.\n\n**Why should Rarible DAO approve this?**\n\nWe need to be thoughtful about how we manage our assets.

Develop applications and ideas for applications that will help the other projects get started quickly\n2. Help raise awareness about the DAO and ecosystem. Showcase what is being built, and how we are the leading NFT innovation. This will help attract more builders who are interested in shaping the future of NFTs on top of the Rarible protocol.\n3. Help developers working on the protocol\n4. Day to day communication and cooperation with DAO for the development needs and expansion of use cases.\n\n### My Background:\n\nI have been a full stack engineer for 3 years so far. Working on web applications in both the Web2 and Web3 space. My initiative is to completely switch to Web3 with full time commitment working for the DAO. I am the Frontend lead and a Co-Founder of Radical, a protocol that was funded by Rarible DAO and gives 30% of it\u2019s governance token to the DAO. I feel really comfortable in the Rarible ecosystem and would like to provide my services and my knowledge as a software engineer to boost the DAO beyond every expectation. My work and specific background is all around the links below.\n\n### Useful links\/ Contact information:\n\nEmail:\u00a0[velkoskis@gmail.com](mailto:velkoskis@gmail.com)\n\nLinkedin:\u00a0[https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/stefan-velkoski-9924a3170\/\u00a01](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/stefan-velkoski-9924a3170\/)\n\nGithub:\u00a0[https:\/\/github.com\/StefanVelkoski](https:\/\/github.com\/StefanVelkoski)\n\nDiscord: sv#2359\n\nTwitter:\u00a0[https:\/\/twitter.com\/stefannv93\u00a01](https:\/\/twitter.com\/stefannv93)\n\n### Funding Milestones and Payments\n\nThe first scope of my engagement will be to build a front-end lazy minting interface, where people can really easily lazy mint items to the protocol. Brief overview:\n\n1. Ability for a user to lazy mint single or multiple 721s.\n2. Ability to choose to create a new collection for your 721, or select an existing collection to mint to.\n3. Ability to upload an image, and select the number of items to mint.\n4. Optional ability to upload which address has the ability to claim these NFTs, and how many items each user can claim.\n5. The ability to set a price for these NFTs.\n6. All of the above is on a single page.\n7. \u201cCLAIMS\u201d page. Users should be able to log in, and see all the NFTs they can claim. Once they claim, the items disappear from this page. Some of the items they will need to pay for (with a price), others will only need gas (set price to 0).\n8. Home page and a success page after minting that redirects to\u00a0[rarible.com](http:\/\/rarible.com\/)\n\nI propose to work for 8 hours every day for 5 days at a rate of $35 per hour ( $5600 per month paid in RARI) .\n\nIf mandatory work is needed during some weekends it will be included within this rate.\n\nPayments will be made to the following Ethereum address:\n\n0x559441FEf78b7E27b66db69C11e5B3827e1aea96\n\nvelkoskis.eth\n\nI consider myself an independent contractor of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 or other applicable forms will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to me.\n\n### Accountability\n\nI will attend weekly community calls where I share my progress to the community, providing and updating the milestones accordingly as I make progress.\n\nI will be available full time for any meetings or discussions ( urgent or scheduled ) as a development representative of the DAO, regardless of time zone differentiation.","protocol":"rarible","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x70b71b98c8b95643462C68e0A396d0a6d15337bf","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":13175394,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rarible.eth\/proposal\/QmcdiBsYV4r2Gf3kyzVGBMU1Bpa5EUe2g1UaKwuAbELJCM","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1631406600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1631838600}","startTimestamp":1631406600,"endTimestamp":1631838600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Vote FOR', 'Vote AGAINST']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

Investors lock their funds in the Crowd on-chain investment pools.\n2. Crowd protocol buys an NFT on Rarible.\n3. Crowd smart-contract locks the NFT in a vault.\n4. Crowd smart-contract issues ERC-20 tokens that represent the ownership of the underlying NFT and distributes the tokens to investors proportionally to their investments in the pool.\n5. Investors trade their fractions (ERC-20 tokens) on Crowd protocol\u2019s internal DEX with commission distributed between Crowd token holders.\n6. With the decision of fractions\u2019 holders or some other predetermined conditions, Crowd protocol puts the NFT for sale on Rarible at the price of its Market Capitalization.\n\n**Vision**\n\nWe believe that the Crowd protocol will become a solution for anyone interested in investing in Mythical NFTs. The solution will suit everyone: minor investors with small budgets, huge investors who would like to diversify, and traders searching for new markets for trading.\n\nAlso, the protocol will be deeply integrated into the Rarible ecosystem, which will add new functions and capabilities to a large number of Rarible protocol users. It will be a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution for every involved actor.\n\n**Competitive Analysis**\n\nFor the time being, there is only one working protocol, which implements this idea: [https:\/\/fractional.art](https:\/\/fractional.art\/). However, it does not have an ERC-20 DEX under the hood. Thus, it is not able to generate trading commissions. Moreover, the protocol does not have integrations with marketplaces, and thus, cannot be profitable for Rarible DAO.\n\n**Detailed Roadmap**\n\nLink: [https:\/\/obsidian-tapir-baa.notion.site\/178428c180de4aaa96d84573f6fe441f?v=10b5bb7fe7a940b797d702503e64d0c0](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/178428c180de4aaa96d84573f6fe441f)\n\n**Funding Milestones and Payments**\n\n1. **Milestone 1 (Sep 13, 2021 \u2192 Oct 10, 2021):**\n\nCrowd protocol V1 (fractionalization and crowd-investing), the start of integration\n\n**We already have a\u00a0 working prototype of Crowd protocol V1 developed during the summer Definition hackathon.**\n\nContracts: [https:\/\/github.com\/FarFlare\/satellites](https:\/\/github.com\/FarFlare\/satellites)\n\nFrontend (Rinkeby): [https:\/\/farflare.github.io\/FarFlareFront\/](https:\/\/farflare.github.io\/FarFlareFront\/)\n\n1. **Milestone 2 (Oct 11, 2021 \u2192 Nov 7, 2021):**\n\nLanding page with description, whitepaper, and first integration\n\n1. **Milestone 3 (Nov 8, 2021 \u2192 Dec 26, 2021):**\n\nCrowd protocol V2 (internal DEX for NFTs\u2019 fractions trading)\n\nWe consider ourselves independent contractors of the Rarible DAO and will report taxes accordingly.

The first working group experiment has been a huge success, which has allowed us to move quickly as a group, fund workers, give contributors small tips, as well as feel empowered with direct governance over funds.\n\n### Working Group details\n\n- Voting power in the working group will include the following people:\n    - Eric Arsenault, Isaac, Luis, Jonathan, Brody, Eugene, Alex, Jeff, Eduard, Skogard, as well as various others who have been very active in the community\n- Funds will be used to pay for various dev efforts, including our dev relations team.\n- We will place a constraint on the DAO of 30 members. Once we reach 30 members, the working group will divide into two groups of 15 member (or multiple smaller groups).\n- This is an experiment in structuring our DAO. There is a lot to learn, and may not be the long term structure of the DAO.\n- This working group (as well as others that might emerge), may become good candidates for delegation once this feature is live on the protocol.\n\nEric Arsenault will act as the representative for this group, and ensure funds move to the DAO wallet address.\n\nPayments will be made bi-weekly or monthly (as needed) to the following Ethereum address: 0xc9044DaabF32659aF9E6ecc58C7247f3Ec7d9C2f\n\nSome funds will be swapped for USDC and some other will be kept in RARI (2\/3 swapped, 1\/3 RARI)\n\nIndividuals who are paid by this working group will consider themselves independent contractors and will report taxes accordingly. Forms W8-BEN and W9 will be filled out accordingly before funds get distributed to them when appropriate. Eric will be responsible for collecting these forms.\n\n### Funding amount, and use of funds\n\n$300K equivalent in RARI as an initial amount of funding for the working group. These funds will be used to:\n\n- Pay workers for their contributions\n- Fund grants devs in our ecosystem think are important, including public goods\n- We expect these funds will last a number of months (>4)\n\nWe are expecting to pay roughly four devs to start working and experimenting with the protocol: Stefan, Way too Digital, Matt and Terrence (roughly 50K month, but to a large extent TBD). Salaries individuals will need to have the accountability and reporting requirements to ensure we have a performing group.\n\nThe amounts reserved for grants will be reported on as well by the dev working group, and will be funded on an ad-hoc basis.\n\n### Accountability\n\nThe working group will be completely transparent around how funds are used, and provide reports at the end of each month outlining expenses.\n\nMembers of the working group will continue attending community calls and will participate in governance processes.\n\n### Why should Rarible DAO fund this?\n\nWe need to keep pushing forward with the execution of a decentralized ecosystem. Empowering working groups is a key part of this process. Expect more of this soon.","protocol":"rarible","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x70b71b98c8b95643462C68e0A396d0a6d15337bf","totalVotes":33,"blockNumber":13175392,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/rarible.eth\/proposal\/QmUKRLv4Tq2nSA5Burf1hUKNrqzq2CycHAJGobXRGkHZbu","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1630974600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1631406600}","startTimestamp":1630974600,"endTimestamp":1631406600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Vote FOR', 'Vote AGAINST']","results":"[{'total': 12334.383, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Firstly, these proposals should be a Treasury Distribution Proposal as the developer(s) portion of the bounty will be considered paid by the DAO. If the bounty is capable of paying directly to multiple parties (the developers and the DAO), then that payment should be utilized. Otherwise the DAO should be paid and left to disburse the funds manually.\n\nAs for the actual format of the proposal, I propose we require the following items regarding the bounty: name, url, description, how it serves the DAO, participants (developers and non-technical), and expected pay.\n\n## Standard Requirements ##\nName: the name of the bounty\nURL: a direct link to the public posting of the bounty\nDescription: a brief description of the bounty (can be copy+paste from the original post)\nHow it serves the DAO: an explanation of how the bounty advances the mission of REtoken DAO and brings it closer to its goals\nA list of participants: a list of all the users participating. Participants may submit a user id or address\nExpected pay: how much each participant expects to be paid. The total expected pay plus the amount sent to REtoken DAO must equal the amount of the bounty. All funds must be accounted for. The developers may also request that some amount of REtoken DAO be minted as payment.\n\nApproval of this proposal will result in the above outline being added to the DAOs docs as a standard. All future proposals related to complete bounties and hackathons on the behalf of REtoken must provide at least all of the information on the standard. It is also encouraged that future proposers discuss their proposal with the community prior to the vote.\n\nOnce a team has an approval and they are set to begin working, it is recommended that the team uses Coordinape to manage team payment.","protocol":"retoken","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x41A7758CAA1fe15bE9f9432c9DeB06FAec08989A","totalVotes":7,"blockNumber":22212561,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/retokendao.eth\/proposal\/0xf0f56a601da7d456a0d0b36b9797c5475df958ae00ab8699c31bd499ef789851","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638820800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639425600}","startTimestamp":1638820800,"endTimestamp":1639425600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Yes - Let's start innovating\", 'No - Use different incentives']","results":"[{'total': 10979.99, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

After careful discussions and analysis, the team came to a few important conclusions:\n\n1. We believe that Crypto Voxels is the most appropriate virtual world platform for SEEN. Compared to other virtual worlds, the Voxels community has an established predisposition for high art and we believe this will be a very effective way to grow our user base. \n\n2. While we considered purchasing our own land to build, the team eventually decided that the most effective and efficient course of action would be to rent a gallery within the MoCA itself. The museum is located in a prime location of the Voxels world, in close proximity to other major galleries and displays. \n\nWe believe the partnership with MoCA provides a clear value proposition and will increase the strength of the brand and lead to increased revenue streams for SEEN going forward, which will only serve to benefit SEEN stakers. \n\n# Objectives:\n\n- **Increased awareness with a targeted demographic:** The MoCA has very consistent daily traffic numbers and we believe gaining exposure with that community will increase our user base, bidding volume, and ultimately our total revenue. We believe that prioritizing growth is of the utmost importance and we are continually looking for ways to do that.\n\n- **Gain traction in an emerging sector:** The virtual worlds sector of NFTs has seen tremendous growth over the past year. This allows the SEEN team to experiment with the platform to get a feel for what works and what doesn\u2019t without a long term financial commitment. \n\n- **A multifunctional display area:** The gallery will allow both auction winners to proudly display their pieces for museum visitors to see, as well as give SEEN a great place to advertise upcoming auctions & build excitement. \n\n- **Recruiting advantages to attract new artists:** Having a virtual gallery can be a key differentiator for SEEN versus its competitors in the space; artists will also benefit from the increased exposure to their own art & brand, a factor that can be used as an important selling point for our recruitment. \n\n- **Strengthen the SEEN brand & other intangible effects:** We believe that expanding the reach of the SEEN community will widen the network effects of the brand, and reinforce the idea of SEEN being a major player with long term aspirations within the crypto art community.  \n\nOverall we believe that having a virtual gallery will help facilitate the onboarding process for newer artists to the space, since the concepts of a digital gallery can be paralleled to those of a physical gallery.\n\nThe gallery will be custom designed with SEEN green, of course, and the partnership with MoCA will provide further synergies down the road. \n\n# SPECIFICATIONS:\n\nThe deal negotiated with Benoit includes the following: \n\n- Custom design and architectural work in creating the SEEN art gallery\n\n- Six (6) month rental for a space inside the Museum of Crypto Art\n\n- Training tutorials to onboard the SEEN team on the Voxels platform\n\n- Promotional materials (including, but not limited to: special community events within the MoCA and billboard space within the Voxels world)\n\n**The package costs 5 ETH and the team plans to draw those funds from the treasury.**\n\n We also reserve the right to extend the lease at the same rate for up to another year, at the team\u2019s discretion. \n","protocol":"seen","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xA75d56979E5eb9bC24D6FAEb4B5B2C35589168A5","totalVotes":33,"blockNumber":11970028,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/seen\/proposal\/QmSVKgy25Cr2zCYDSQLj3qMZEzDi9amLC6VynukTaaxrq5","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1614866400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1615039200}","startTimestamp":1614866400,"endTimestamp":1615039200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 73863.87, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Generating more revenue for artists will allow the SEEN platform to scale and encourage bigger artists to work with Seen Haus. \n\nFor Customers: If you win the auction, you will own the physical artwork, an NFT and royalties from any additional NFT sales therefore subsidizing your original purchase price.

The trial period will end on 16 February 2022 and without a new proposal the TMDC will dissolve.\n\nBased on the successful performance of the TMDC during the trial period this proposal is for the DAO to authorize the continuance of the TMDC from 17 February 2022 on an indefinite basis with the proposed amendments to its mandate below which are based on the lessons observed during the trial period.\n\nAbstract:\n\nIf the proposal is passed, the TMDC will continue to manage the treasury for the long term benefit of the DAO to seize opportunities and mitigate risks by using measured decision processes. TMDC committee members will be compensated and the committee member slate will adopt a six month renewal cycle.  The TDMC will strive to finish the term with $4M in new stablecoins.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe original impetus to form the TMDC was that we did not want to have every tokenomics decision have to go through full governance because of the delay of time from ideation to execution limited the DAO\u2019s ability to respond to opportunities and risks to the treasury. Specifically, to seize opportunities to diversify and accrue stable coins in our treasury. Concurrently, the TDMC was also directed to provide a layer of due diligence and to take measured decisions.\n\nWithout a continuance, the TMDC will dissolve at the end of the trial period on Feb 16, 2022. After that date, the DAO will revert to its previous risk profile without a time-agile response capability to accrue stable coins and it could take too long to take advantage of opportunities to diversify our treasury.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nThe specifications of the continued committee will be the same as [SCP-36] with the following amendments:\n\nAmendment #1: Members of the committee (with the exception of Kent, who is already compensated as the Tokenomics Workstream leader) will be compensated in FOX at a rate of 4000 FOX per month.\n\nDuring the trial period, committee members were not compensated. This was because the level of effort was unknown and the value of the committee was unproven. The TMDC met not less than 16 times, studied, deliberated and made asset assignments 15 times. The level of effort and responsibility is substantial. As explained in the State of the Treasury section below the Fox Treasury position is now streaming approximately $44,000 USDC per day into the treasury as a benefit from the TMDC work.\n\nTMDC should be compensated in FOX to incentivize committee members to be long Fox; and a study of fair compensation suggests a range of 3000-4000 FOX per month as reasonable for the level of effort and responsibility. Given the positive performance of the TMDC the value should be at the upper range.\n\nAmendment #2: TMDC will track its activities and provide the DAO with a monthly status of activities within 7 days of the last day of the month each month. Compensation will be conditional upon the production of the monthly summary.\n\nAmendment #3: Pending governance approval and deployment of the FOXy token\/contract, the TMDC will be tasked with managing token swaps and other relevant mechanics in order to generate rewards (which will in turn be distributed to FOXy holders).\nAmendment #4: The TDMC will strike to finish the term with $4M in new stablecoins.\n\nGovernance of the Committee:\n\nThe governance of the continued committee will be the same as [SCP-36] with the following amendments:\n\nAmendment #5: The slate of committee membership will be approved by the DAO on a six month cycle from the approval date.\n\nAmendment #6: The proposed slate of members for the continued committee for the first six month cycle are:\n\nAmicus.eth \/ Rotorless | albitrage \/ Al | profMcC | seven7hwave\/ Kent | JonisJon\n\nState of the Treasury:\n\nTl;dr - the FOX treasury is receiving yield from TMDC work.\n\nThe most significant achievement during the trial period is incoming stablecoin streams to the ShapeShift treasury achieving the mandate of the TMDC.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe link below shows a value of $830,000 USDC in accumulated yields from TMDC assignments to the initial FOX\/USDC Bond that was transferred into the ShapeShift treasury on 7 Feb .\n\nhttps:\/\/etherscan.io\/token\/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48?a=0x90a48d5cf7343b08da12e067680b4c6dbfe551be\n\nThe current streaming revenue is Approximately $40,000 USDC.  Additionally, the TMDC has increased the assignment to the FOX\/USDC fund to yield an estimated $100,000 USDC per day for the next 3 months.\n\nMost, but not all (limitations of aggregation) of the treasury positions can be viewed on this zapper link here:\n\nhttps:\/\/zapper.fi\/account\/0x90a48d5cf7343b08da12e067680b4c6dbfe551be?tab=dashboard\n\nThe Fox and Frens Rari pool can be viewed here: https:\/\/app.rari.capital\/fuse\/pool\/79\/info\n\nThe Fox Tokemak reactor can be viewed here: https:\/\/www.tokemak.xyz\/\n\nThe Olympus Fox\/USDC bond offer can be viewed here: Olympus Pro - Bond marketplace for protocol owned liquidity 1\n\nIf you are into it you can track these other activities on etherscan (see my comment above on producing a monthly summary):\n\nDeposit $5M FEI\nDeposit $50,000 Silo Finance\nDeposit $3M In Tokemak\nDeposit $ 1M FOX\/USDC BOND for 1 month at payout of $40,000 FOX\nDeposit $1.7M FOX to increase collateral in Rari Fox & Frens\nBorrowed $1M in FEI, swapped for $1M USDC\nSold $150,000 of Toke for $150,000 USDC\nDeposit $3.5M Fox into Angel Vault\nDeposit $1M FOX\/USDC BOND Increase monthly payout to $100,000 FOX\nDelegated authority to manage FOX\/USDC Bond to the Bond Committee.\nAdded FOX\/ETH LP to the the FOX & Frens Rari Pool\nExtended the FOX\/USDC $2M Bond at $100,000 FOX payout for 3 months\nDeposit 39,920 USDC to Pendo\nRe-collateralize $900K worth of FOX and 450K USDC in Angel Vault.\n\nRequirements:\n\nThe TMDC priority will continue to take a holistic approach to DAO treasury management, and act toward the long-term success of FOX token and the ShapeShift DAO. The committee will remain a dedicated team of FOX members carefully watching, acting and working with each other on a weekly basis.\n\nAt the time of writing there was 198M FOX in the Sablier wallet and 237M FOX in the Shapeshift treasury wallet. The initial allocation to the TMDC was 60M FOX. Approximately 15.5M FOX remains. No increase in control over additional funds is proposed for the next cycle.\n\nThe committee will administer the pools the community owns. If the committee should want to sell FOX: The committee\u2019s actions should have limited price impact on the FOX token, no one tactic can drop the price by more than 2%.\n\nRoadmap:\n\nTMDC continues to develop tools and processes for treasury management with a view towards continuity of knowledge to enable succession of committee members.\n\nBenefits:\n\nTo continue to be capable to act quickly, manage and execute on treasury management and diversification strategies to allow for a more active, holistic and long-term approach to treasury management.

The workstream additionally provides similar support and structure to the DAO and its ecosystem and networks.\n\nThrough Production Issue Procedure Best Practices, Triage Management, Deployment and Regression Testing, and DAO Admin Procedures and Practices, the ShapeShift DAO Operations Workstream provides essential resources and tools for efficiency, organization, and overall product and services health that are vital to the success of the DAO, the product suite, it\u2019s contributors, and $FOX token utility.\n\nMotivation\nThe Operations workstream works side by side with other workstreams to increase efficiency and help progress deployment and testing processes while still verifying and maintaining reliability, health, and full functionality of all provided services.\n\nThis allows the Engineering workstream to spend more time building and deploying, the Product workstream to spend more time scoping, designing, and implementing, the C-Mods more C-Mod time, etc\u2026 Funding this workstream empowers Operations to continue to scale the team, complete the above stated goals through the developed procedures and processes, and organize and provide updates, resources, communication, coordination, documentation and any other need that may arise from other workstreams, the DAO Community, and its processes.\n\nThe Operations workstream is the only workstream focused on the wider picture of the product suite\u2019s uptime, functionality, and overall health. It additionally mirrors that responsibility in the DAO Discord and Notion by synergizing and coordinating cross stream collaboration further strengthening the DAO.\n\nSpecification\nThe Operations workstream Notion repo can be found here.\n\nThe renewal for this workstream and contributors is 6 months from February 1st to July 31st. This proposal continues @Tyler | ShapeShift as the workstream leader and @Tshifty @Lych @Ron\/PTT and @Neverwas as Operations Assistants with the additional budget to hire 4 additional assistants in 2 waves during the term.\n\nBudget: Total potential max budget $411,000 (6 months)\nBudget breakdown can be viewed on the Forum post here: https:\/\/forum.shapeshift.com\/t\/scp-59-proposal-to-fund-the-operations-workstream-for-a-second-term\/1085\n\nThe changes to the budget from the previous term is the addition of another potential assistant, an increase in the allotted monthly test fund budget to meet the growing needs of test requirements and network fees, the addition of a $2K\/month bounty fund, and an increase in the discretionary funds to $1k\/month for a larger team. As with the previous budget, all unused funds will be returned to the DAO treasury (Root) at the end of the term.\n\nSpecific Goals and Success Metrics\nThe goals and success metrics for the Operations Workstream are broken into two sections in this term, current measurables, and focuses for future KPIs next term.\n\nCurrent Measurables:\n\nProduction Issue Best Practices\n\nGoals:\n\nTo minimize downtime of the entire product suite.\nTo resolve production environment bugs efficiently with minimal disruption to engineering processes, deployment cadences, or user experience.\nKPIs:\n\n99% uptime of the product suite and services (99.969% last term)\n<10 Production Issue Escalations per Quarter (8 Escalations in Q4 2021)\n<50 Total Combined DAO Contributor hours dedicated to Production Issue Resolutions (Q4 2021 - 20 hours)\nTriage Management\n\nGoals:\n\nTo discover, isolate, navigate, and manage resolutions of user facing issues in all ShapeShift products and services.\nTo provide known troubleshooting and mitigation steps for issue reporters and users during the discovery and recreation of triage tickets.\nTo mitigate and expedite time required from core contributors spent on bug tickets, issue reports, and production level emergencies.\nTo transfer correctly completed and accurate Github tickets of triage bugs to Engineering or Product to be posted for bounty.\nKPIs:\n\nGreater than 80% resolution rate goal (86.55% resolution rate last term)\nDeployment and Regression Testing\n\nGoals:\n\nTo catch 95% of prod issues during deployment testing process.\nTo catch user facing issues in production environments in regression tests and #triage them accordingly.\nA deployment test completed twice by the Operations Workstream during each release process:\nA full regression test performed once a day by an Operations Workstream contributor.\nOperations prioritizes blocking bugs, supporting engineers, and efficiency in the processes already in place over chasing non-blocking bugs for a \u2018perfected\u2019 release.\nKPIs:\n\n<2 Cadences missed per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (1 cadence missed last term)\n<2 Rollbacks during releases per quarter due to bugs overlooked in Ops Testing (2 Rollbacks occurred last term)\nDAO Admin Procedures and Practices\n\nGoals:\n\nTo organize successful DAO meetings related to Goat\/No Goat, Retros, and Ops Sprints.\nTo track, organize, record keep, and optimize DAO repos keeping them current and relevant.\nTo provide assistance in projects that require support in generating procedures to be completed for the DAO or other workstreams.\nNext Term Success Metrics:\nNow that the workstream has been established and developed a bit, future focuses of KPIs for the second term include:\n\nKPIs for DAO Admin procedure practices\nKPIs around regression testing template times, and completion rate\nKPIs around lowering test fund costs compared to network fees\nKPIs about bugs turned into successful bounties by Operations Contributors\nAdditional focus and detail added to current KPIs based on the numbers and data collected\nBenefits\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will continue to fund the Operations workstream budget to meet the deliverables and services outlined which are integral to the DAO\u2019s success and current practices. Coverage for Prod Issue escalations Triage Management Regularly scheduled regression and deployment testing Cross workstream alignment and stakeholder resources would all be focuses maintained and improved upon by the workstream.\n\nPassing this proposal will continue uninterrupted support and services offered from the Operations workstream to the DAO.\n\nDrawbacks\nFunding this workstream does cost money and the budget does have a slight increase from last month in regards to team size and test fund allocations. This workstream would cost the DAO treasury potentially $411,000 over 6 months (~$68,500\/month) if all funds are needed and exhausted in the budget.\n\nVote\n\nFor: You support funding the Operations Workstream\u2019s anticipated budget for 6 months totaling $411,000\n\nAgainst: You do not support continuing to fund the Operations Workstream.","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xba9356f8825D4ba92C437b6041AaC8dC9F1c931A","totalVotes":156,"blockNumber":14147995,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/QmR5k1196Nb6aKsHxTgZkd1fjvZ1WwfuT9ApghKZ1PFxDH","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644105600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644451200}","startTimestamp":1644105600,"endTimestamp":1644451200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 4278485.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 860, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Summary\nIn order to fully decentralize the backend of ShapeShift it is vital to have a source of reliable, indexed, and decentralized node data for all chains that are supported by the ShapeShift interface. If anyone is going to host decentralized copies of indexed node data, there needs to be an incentivization structure in place to reward them for their work. \nFOXChain, a purpose-built blockchain built on the cosmos SDK, has been proposed to solve both problems and has been discussed numerous times in the ShapeShift DAO community over the last 45 days. The purpose of this proposal is to formalize and fund the next steps of the development of this important piece of decentralized infrastructure.\n\n# 2. Abstract\nThis proposal outlines the first phase of necessary actions to be taken in order to make FOXCHAIN a reality. This first phase will fund the following deliverables to the ShapeShift DAO community:\n\n1. A technical scope document, including engineering requirements for FOXChain as well as any necessary diagrams and supporting documentation\n2. A spreadsheet that models the necessary FOX support needed for supporting the security of FOXChain and related tokenomics of supporting the chain\n3. a Proof of Concept built on top of the Cosmos SDK that will serve as the initial reference implementation of FOXChain for testnet purposes\n4. The hiring of an engineering lead and supporting team who will support (1), (2), and (3) and be poised to rapidly iterate into phase 2 of fully building out the FOXChain once the (1), (2), and (3) are fully delivered to the community.\n\nNote: Cosmos is proposed as an ideal candidate due to its a) Tendermint consensus, and b) bonding\/slashing mechanisms required for the implementation of FOXChain.\n\n# 3. Motivation\nThe motivation for building FOXChain runs on a number of different paths, but primarily it serves as the long term decentralized backend for all node data the ShapeShift interface will ever need. FOXCHAIN will act as a service for any application requiring reliable access to a consistent interface to any of the supported blockchains, in order to increase dapp development velocity, reduce reliance on centralized data sources, remove single points of failure, and increase censorship-resistance. On top of this there are many additional benefits that can be built out once the ShapeShift DAO has its own sovereign blockchain, though that does not serve as the primary motivation at this phase.\n\n# 4. Specification\nIn order to move forward on the creation of FOXChain, this proposal asks for the creation of a purpose built workstream and appointing Michael Perklin (@mperklin) as its workstream leader. The workstream will deliver on (1), (2), (3), and (4) as defined in the abstract. In more a detailed sense this includes:\n\n1. The workstream will work on breaking down the technical scope of the FOXChain, including getting feedback from various technical stakeholders in the DAO and larger crypto community (such as Cosmos core devs, other Cosmos SDK chain developers, and other DeFi projects) in order to produce a full initial technical requirements document and any necessary design diagrams to inform future developers of FOXChain.\n2. The workstream will work with contributors to model out the tokenomics of FOXChain including the costs associated with running each ShapeShift supported blockchain and index, projected necessary FOX needed to subsidize months\/years of node subsidies, FOXChain revenue generation for the DAO over the long term, and any other components to properly model FOXChain tokenomics.\n3. The workstream will work to either hire or bounty out developers in order to produce a FOXChain proof of concept which will be informed by (1) and (2) and will serve to launch the initial FOXChain testnet which can be iterated on in phase 2 to launch FOXChain into production.\n4. The workstream will work to hire an engineering lead and supporting team who can support (1), (2), and (3) as necessary but also more importantly so that team can be poised to be funded in phase 2 to iterate and launch the production version of FOXChain to mainnet.\n\nIn order to deliver on the above Phase 1 FOXChain scope, this proposal requests 300,000 USDC as funding (or equivalent FOX). If funded, Michael Perklin will take receipt of these 300,000 USDC at his consulting company (ETH address 0x9125F9e3FB19C57A341311Ab70Ba591333a333B3) and will have full authority to spend this 300,000 USDC in any way he feels will make progress towards achieving the FOXCHAIN objectives laid out in this proposal. The funding will be transferred in three separate 100,000 USDC transactions over three months. Any funds remaining after these objectives have been fulfilled will either be retained to fulfill future \"Phase 2\" proposals for FOXCHAIN, or will be returned to the DAO treasury if the DAO decides no future work on FOXCHAIN will be funded. Michael Perklin will be responsible for maintaining records related to the disbursement of funds and will share these records with ShapeShift DAO to ensure transparency.\n\n# 5. Benefits\nThe benefits of this proposal will include the first necessary steps to create FOXChain, a vital piece of infrastructure needed to decentralize ShapeShift\u2019s backend and also provide the world and other interfaces with essential infrastructure (reliable, incentivized, indexed, blockchain data across many blockchains). In addition to this vital infrastructure, FOXChain will also likely become a significant source of revenue for the DAO over the long term if the project is successful.\n\n# 6. Drawbacks\nThe drawbacks of this proposal will be that it is a considerable sum to invest at this stage with no guarantee of success. The DAO will have to trust Mperklin to diligently put the right people and pieces in place to deliver on the scope laid out in this proposal. It is possible that phase 2 is not funded, and this never gets delivered to a production mainnet. It is also possible that a better solution or other alternative solutions out in the market end up being better suited to solve what FOXChain is trying to solve.\n","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9125F9e3FB19C57A341311Ab70Ba591333a333B3","totalVotes":71,"blockNumber":14070336,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0x09b72abb180920318e5b313d4c381c76f7bd47171f9dd6853b1752ccfd5d38a8","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643058000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643662800}","startTimestamp":1643058000,"endTimestamp":1643662800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES - send 300k USD to @mperklin', 'NO - do nothing']","results":"[{'total': 4993919, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 200, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This would effectively extend and modify the current phase, which ends in late-February.\n\nThe strategy entails maintaining liquidity mining rewards near or at current levels for an additional 4.5 months, while at the same time aggressively increasing the DAO\u2019s Olympus Pro bond LP token purchases. This could reduce the effective cost of liquidity mining, while also jumpstarting a program to put the majority of the DAO\u2019s liquidity in its own treasury.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nCurrently ShapeShift is spending a substantial amount of FOX in order to maintain our liquidity mining program. This plays an important role in both ensuring that FOX has a presence on Uniswap and throughout the DeFi ecosystem, as well as expanding the universe of FOX holders.\n\nAt the same time, the DAO is operating in an environment where various newer DeFi protocols have enabled protocol treasuries to hold their own liquidity. This new paradigm allows projects to enjoy the best of both worlds, ensuring that there\u2019s sufficient liquidity while avoiding typical downsides that arise from liquidity mining\u2013for instance, \u201cmercenary\u201d liquidity providers who quickly head for the exits and sell a token soon after they earn those rewards.\n\nThe two steps contained in this proposal would effectively allow the DAO to engage in both behaviors: continuing its liquidity mining rewards while also using its ample FOX reserves to begin purchasing its own liquidity via an Olympus bond.\n\nWhat this proposal would do:\n\n1.) Continue our current liquidity mining rewards in the Uniswap FOX\/ETH pool for an additional 4.5 months, targeting a 75% APR or higher (funded with 13.5 mil FOX over the period). This mirrors our current approach.\n\n2.) Utilize our current FOX\/ETH Olympus Pro bond in order to aggressively purchase our own liquidity. Specifically, the DAO would fund an Olympus Bond program over the following 4.5 months (concurrent with the ongoing LP program) to purchase FOX\/ETH LP tokens, targeting $40 million worth of liquidity. $50 million worth of FOX would be earmarked and deployed for this purpose over the course of the 4.5-month period.\n\nNote that the strategy outlined here doesn\u2019t speak much to how exactly we\u2019ll implement the LP repurchases via Olympus. This ambiguity is intentional; it leaves our team enough flexibility, with respect to both position sizing and timing, to react to market feedback. For instance, If our bonds are not selling and\/or liquidity starts rapidly declining (and not just because of markets in general dropping), this would suggest that we should adjust the strategy.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019d begin the program very aggressively, perhaps with 10X to 20X our current purchases, in order to quickly increase our Protocol Owned Liquidity.\n\nWith respect to management of the revised bond program\u2019s parameters, the existing FOX Bond Committee would be a logical choice; it already had competency and knowledge around these operations. The Committee\u2019s current term expires at the end of the current bond program. Should it be amenable to renewing for another 4.5 months under the modified proposal, its ongoing work would be invaluable in executing this proposal\u2019s strategy.\n\nWhat exactly does this vote do?\n\nYES:\n\n1.) On February 22nd at 9am MST (48 hours before the second round of FOX\/ETH liquidity mining ends), deploy a third round of liquidity mining rewards for the Uniswap v2 FOX\/ETH Pool of 13.5M FOX rewarded over 4.5 months (targeting 75% or higher APR).\n\n2.) Fund an aggressive Olympus Bond program over the following 4.5 months (concurrent with the ongoing LP program) to purchase FOX\/ETH LP tokens, targeting $40 million worth of liquidity. $50 million worth of FOX would be earmarked and deployed for this purpose over the course of the 4.5-month period.\n\nNO: No changes are made. (In this case, the DAO will need to pass another proposal if it wants to extend its liquidity mining program past late-February).","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xE56Edf928D813cA9D0530e6Bc893029E07C683C6","totalVotes":164,"blockNumber":14031754,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0xe4af5d04656b4983ceb4c769dca667f88e465d458ac37ae1c5bed5c2db203d18","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1642503600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1643108400}","startTimestamp":1642503600,"endTimestamp":1643108400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES: Implement this proposal', 'NO: No changes are made']","results":"[{'total': 4751154, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

This would include the sponsorship, hosting two events, and fund scholarships for ShapeShift DAO members to attend.\n\nMotivation: Centralized ShapeShift has been attending and sponsoring ETHDenver for the last 5 years, as this event was in our own backyard. Now that we are a DAO and decentralized, we should consider many events, but what better way to start this DAO sponsorship theme than through our roots at ETHDenver. We would also be supporting another DAO, as with the genesis of Spork DAO in June 2021, ETHDenver is the first event based DAO in the world.\n\nOur motivation to sponsor this event is the exposure and supporting the BUIDLer community around us. These attendees are motivated, educated and the right type of connections for our DAO to be building. The attendees of this event include students, developers, technologists, community leaders, educational professionals, entrepreneurs and more.\n\nETH Denver Event Sponsorship:\n\nMetaLite Sponsorship - $20,000\nBenefits\n3 Sporkwhale tickets\nLogo on promos and PR\nSocial, Blog and PR communications\nSponsor table\nBounty Prize Limit: $15,000\n1 Panel Spot or 1 Workshop\nBounties - $15,000\nSwag for the table, and incentives to achieve our goals. $6,500\nTshirts\/ Stickers\n$500 of this budget would go to designs\nScholarships for DAO community members to attend $6,500\nWhile the event is a free event, it does require travel to get out here.

Coin Center is the leading non-profit focused on the policy issues facing cryptocurrencies. They engage in research, educate policymakers, and advocate for sensible regulatory approaches to this technology. Another reason for hosting a fundraiser as the DAO is to show we have a vested interest in this community and its future.\n\nThe theme of the dinner will be Wild West Pioneers. We will invite a few VIP guests of honor who have founded or greatly contributed to the Denver\/ Colorado crypto ecosystem, including Erik Voorhees. This event will be sponsored by the ShapeShift DAO and will cost attendees a 0.5- 1 ETH donation to CoinCenter to attend. Our goal is to raise $100,000 - $200,000 for Coin Center and garner more exposure for our DAO.

To spread the message of our product, drive new and existing users to the mutually beneficial yield farming opportunities therein, and report success metrics back to the DAO.\n____________________________________________________________\nAbstract:\n\nThe Marketing Workstream plays a vital role in promoting the DAO by engaging users, creating marketing campaigns, and executing them across the digital landscape. It is the engine that drives the spreading of the DAO message, coordinating and producing all materials representing our decentralized organization. We believe that our strategies will continue to help achieve our shared vision of a borderless financial system. This is a proposal to fund the Marketing Workstream through June 30, 2022.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO has attracted talent from all over the web and retained fantastic talent from the previous centralized organization. Products continue to be built, and our systems\u2019 capability continues to grow. The Marketing Workstream intends to closely collaborate with the Product Team in order to make current and new users aware of what ShapeShift\u2019s systems capabilities and functions are. Ultimately, we are aiming to acquire and activate new and existing users towards revenue-generating points.\n\nBy creating a workstream that focuses on strategizing, developing, executing, and tracking marketing initiatives for the DAO - any workstream or individual can contribute to ShapeShift DAO marketing. We will collaborate with the DAO and be the workstream responsible for these efforts.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nSpecification:\n\nPropose and execute marketing campaigns that support product launches, partnership agreements, and project integrations.\n\nProduce and distribute quality marketing content for the community.\n\nStrategize community growth and management across Reddit, Telegram, Instagram, Facebook, and other community media outlets.\n\nDrive users to revenue-generating actions and report back to the DAO on progress, current actionable items, and KPIs.\n\nContinually refine and improve strategies across the DAO\u2019s marketing initiatives and community growth.\n\nBuild a workstream that empowers everyone working within the subcommittee to feel heard and at home with the ShapeShift DAO community.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nSpecific Goals & Success Metrics:\n\n1) Leverage Social Media: One of the most important marketing tools for the DAO is social media. Perhaps even more so in the crypto\/defi space, the marketing team shall use social media effectively to connect with the global crypto community and put the spotlight onto various DAO projects.\n\nThe marketing workstream shall be responsible for creating, distributing content and growing the following social media platforms:\n\n - Facebook - Increase followers to 60,000 by June 30th, 2022 (a 19% increase)\n - Instagram - Increase followers to 10,000 by June 30th, 2022 (a 90% increase)\n - Reddit - Increase average unique engagement to 1,500 per month by June 30th, 2022 (a 15% increase)\n - Telegram - Increase followers to 3,500 by June 30th, 2022 (a 45% increase)\n - Youtube - Increase followers to 4,500 by June 30th, 2022 (a 32% increase)\n - Medium - Increase followers to 4,500 by June 30th, 2022 (a 40% increase)\n\n - Influencer\/Affiliate Marketing: There are influencers who are well recognised and respected within the crypto community. Users become confident in projects for many reasons, and if a person they trust is on board with ShapeShift DAO, that is one way we can attract potential FOX holders. Our current best thinking is to engage with a specific type of influencer that meets some or all of the following criteria:\n- Focuses on DeFi Projects.\n- Produces content focused on earning yield on digital assets - rather than buying, waiting for the price to increase, and selling.\n- Understands the utility of the tokens they recommend to their audiences, and can explain how users can best put their token to work.\n- Ideally, we find content creators that help us kill 2 birds with one stone. There is a focus on utility throughout the $FOX ecosystem while at the same time providing tutorial-like instructions though the visual content they create.\n\nDue to the variability in costs when working with influencers, the goal for the workstream during this term is to identify and connect with influencers that meet the DAO\u2019s standards. If the cost of working with an influencer is reasonable, the workstream may fund the partnership through the bounty budget. If the cost would be a significant portion of the bounty budget proposed by the workstream, we plan to present and write separate funding proposals.\n\n3. Content Creation & SEO: By creating content regularly for ShapeShift\u2019s website, search engines will assign more value to it, and thus the website will show up more frequently for terms related to our brand. The website is often the first (and in some cases the only) place people go for information about ShapeShift. The Marketing Workstream will be responsible for keeping Web content current and working with the Product Workstream to execute necessary UI\/UX changes.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of content the workstream will create, optimize, and publish to the website and external channels includes:\n\n- Weekly and Monthly ShapeShift DAO Newsletters.\n- Blogs (both long and short form).\nWritten and video content on processes, walk-throughs and news in the DAO.\n- Graphic design content to be used for engaging audiences on various social media platforms.\n\n4. Press Releases: Publishing press releases is essential in spreading the message of the DAO due to the legitimacy it confers on the project. By creating content suitable for PR and amplifying it with formal press releases, the DAO shows maturity and legitimacy as a brand (ShapeShift) and as a project (ShapeShift DAO).\n\n5. Support the Community: The workstream will build a connection with the community outside of Discord by engaging and answering questions on various social platforms. The workstream will nurture the relationship with the community on a daily basis by being active within the channels and seeding conversation with content created by the DAO.\n\n6. Data DAOshboards: The workstream will work to build a series of dashboards for anyone in the DAO to track progress on:\n\n- Activated FOX - which is FOX that is locked within a contract and not sitting in a wallet, segmented by each opportunity.\n- Number of FOX Token Holders\n- Growth of External Channels\n- A series of dashboards would serve all DAO workstreams tremendously by providing insights to valuable ecosystem data and metrics.\n____________________________________________________________\nProposed Workstream Roles:\n\nFull Time Roles:\n\nWorkstream Leader & Data Lead - @Petecoin\nContent Creation & Distribution Lead - @Arina\nSocial & Community Growth Lead - @ETHan1Elohim\nVideo Streaming & Management - @PTT\n\nBounty Roles that can turn into Part Time \/ Full Time Roles:\n\nDAO Analytics Manager\nSocial Media Channel Managers\nCopywriters\nGraphic Designers\nVideographers\nEmail Managers\n_________________________________________________________________\nBudget:\n\nhttps:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/standard10\/uploads\/foxcookieco\/original\/1X\/e8c6888eff003ec21445ff68cf0b0647996aeff6.png\n\nTotal 6 Month Requested Budget: $351,086\n\nThe budget is designed with these conditions in mind:\n\n - The bounty budget proposed by this workstream is intended to be used to grow the talent pool proposed above - and leave room for valuable bounty hunters to become part or full time contributors.\n   - The intended result is to create a series of redundancies in talent so that the workstream can remain agile to meet marketing demands.\n    - $15,000 per month is split into three buckets:\n    - $5,000 for Content Creation\n    - $5,000 for Community & Social\n    - $5,000 for Data\n  - Any bounty contractors that become full or part time contributors will be compensated either through the bounty budget, or by a separate proposal submitted through DAO governance.\n\n - Any unused funds at the end of the 6 month term will be returned to the DAO with a report released to the community that details where all funds were spent 2. No funding will be rolled over into any subsequent term if this workstream continues past June 30, 2022.\n_________________________________________________________________\nBenefits:\n\nThis workstream ensures that the DAO continues to make current and new users aware of what ShapeShift\u2019s systems capabilities and functions are. Ultimately aiming to acquire and activate new and existing users towards revenue-generating points & reporting all activity back to the DAO at the end of the term.\n\nDrawbacks:\n\nThe main drawback is the cost to fund this workstream, however, we strongly believe a Marketing Workstream is a necessary branch of the DAO and we hope that the community has seen the value and will continue to support us.\n","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xB5C327EF90eC4Ed329321D0f5F30294289B94560","totalVotes":157,"blockNumber":13889659,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0x08226399fbba5d38dd07af8426c57f5d9818f4952ab42c4722acdba0ff3810b2","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640624400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1641229200}","startTimestamp":1640624400,"endTimestamp":1641229200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES - I am in favor', 'NO - I am against']","results":"[{'total': 3668406, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Experience running the centralized RDP has also provided the valuable insight that hanging onto reports for too long presents serious record-keeping issues. Thus, I propose that the DAO\u2019s RDP have an explicit 90-day disclosure policy, with all reports actively published after they are remediated, or after 90 days, whichever comes first.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis program will cover:\n\n - Smart contract code developed by the DAO\n - Smart contract code deployed by the DAO on-chain on a mainnet\n - The specific projects hosted at the following GitHub repositories:\n   - shapeshift\/web\n   - shapeshift\/lib\n   - shapeshift\/unchained\n   - shapeshift\/hdwallet\n   - keepkey\/keepkey-firmware\n\nIn addition, any software hosted under the ShapeShift or KeepKey GitHub Orgs or the @shapeshiftoss NPM Org will be eligible if it is a dependency of something in-scope.\n\n## Specification\n\n### NFT Hall of Fame\n\nI propose that the DAO fund the creation of an NFT-based Hall of Fame on the xDai chain, and that recognition for a researcher\u2019s contributions be provided in tokenized form.\n\n1) A security researcher who submits a valid report will receive an NFT, which will be locked for the duration of the RDP\u2019s 90-day disclosure period. If the issue they\u2019ve reported is later found to be invalid \u2013 or if they choose to disclose it publicly during the embargo period \u2013 the NFT will be revoked.\n2) The NFT will be unlocked automatically upon the expiration of the disclosure period, or earlier once the issue is remediated. Once unlocked, the NFT will pay to its holder a small, fixed bounty, as compensation for their effort in reporting the issue.\n3) The Bounty Committee will meet on a regular basis to evaluate all newly-remediated issues and assign bounties to them. Bounties will be paid out to the holder of the associated NFT. This will enable the researcher to \u201ccash out\u201d early, without needing to wait for the Bounty Committee, by selling their NFT. (Prospective buyers will likely be knowledgeable both about the issue's security impact and the DAO's bounty process, and who thus experience less risk by holding the asset than the researcher themselves.)\n4) The NFT\u2019s metadata will include name and URL fields which the researcher may set and then lock. This ensures that they will retain the credit for their report, even if they do sell the NFT. (The DAO will retain the ability to override a locked NFT's metadata in case of the exercise of Godwin's Law or other exceptional circumstances.)\n\nThe Security Workstream will manage the issuance and revocation these NFTs.\n\n### Bounty Committee\n\nA Bounty Committee will be established for the purpose of reviewing and assigning bounty values to remediated reports. This committee should have good technical and security credentials, but should also represent a cross-section of the DAO community. Its purpose is to avoid the potentially-problematic process of allocating a \u201cbudget\u201d for bounties while providing confidence to the DAO that bounty funds will be well-allocated, as well as to provide assurance to security researchers and prospective holders of Hall of Fame NFTs that reports will receive serious consideration and fair awards.\n\n(Bounty awards are necessarily more qualitative than quantitative, but I also feel that it would be wise for the Committee to publish some general guidelines on what general types of issues will be awarded at what general amounts.)\n\nThe Bounty Committee\u2019s recommendations will be submitted to the DAO in the form of proposals to pay specific bounty amounts directly from the treasury to the holder of a specific Hall of Fame NFT. These bounty proposals may go directly to a vote, skipping the normal forum and ideation steps of the governance process. This will allow the DAO to retain operation oversight of the amounts awarded.\n\nConsidering the impact and complexity of vulnerabilities is highly-skilled and mentally-demanding work, and the members of the the Bounty Committee will need to do it regularly. As such, they will be paid on an hourly basis for their work meeting and scoring reports.\n\nThe Bounty Committee will always contain the current Security Workstream leader; In addition, I nominate @willyfox, @0xdef1cafe, @mperklin, @majorhayes, @adam, and @0xcean, for a starting size of 7 members.\n\n### De-minimis Bounties\n\nAll valid reports deserve some financial recognition, no matter how serious the issue is; there's real overhead associated with engaging with us and reporting responsibly. Researchers should be incentivized by a guaranteed payout to do that even if they're not sure how serious an issue might be, and the Bounty Committee should not feel obligated to burden the DAO with proposals to award bounties to very-low-impact reports.\n\nThe \u201cde minimis\u201d bounty is compensation for participating in the administrative overhead of the reporting process, as well as a good-will bonus. It will be the same for every issue irrespective of the issue\u2019s impact or technical complexity; those factors will be considered by the Bounty Committee and may result in an additional award. It will be paid automatically upon remediation of the issue or expiry of the 90-day confidentiality period.\n\nBounty awards by the committee will be paid in FOX, but the de-minimis bounties will instead be paid in xDai. Paying in xDai avoids the need for an on-chain price oracle to ensure the consistent value of payouts, and also ensures that even researchers new to xDai or crypto entirely will have enough gas to work with after an award.\n\n## Budget\n\n### Development of Hall of Fame contract\n\nThe contract powering the NFT Hall of Fame will not be handling large amounts of money or any user funds, so it won't need the same level of paranoia as most DeFi smart contracts, and I don't see an external audit as an essential part of the process. The DAO should retain the ability to edit or censor NFT metadata, and shenanigans should be revertable. (I envision the Hall of Fame being deployed as an upgradable proxy owned by the DAO's Colony instance.)\n\nOpenZeppelin has most of the infrastructure needed for development of a custom NFT contract like the Hall of Fame; I don't see this as a huge lift, but it will require development, and the work should be compensated. It would be a great choice for outsourcing via a Gitcoin bounty or something similar.\n\nUpon passage of this proposal, $15,000 will be allotted to the Security Workstream for bounties related to the development of the Hall of Fame.\n\n### On-Call Rotation\n\nThe Security Workstream will run an on-call rotation to triage and respond to vulnerability reports. While subject to change as operationally indicated, this will initially take the form of week-long on-call slots.\n\nOn passage of this proposal, $26,000 will be allotted to the Security Workstream for coverage of the first 6 months of this duty. Workstream members on call may request reimbursement at the rate of $1000\/week.\n\n### Software Licenses (i.e. ZenDesk)\n\nThough we may transition to a different solution in the future, for the moment ZenDesk is a good fit for our needs. ZenDesk licenses are $150 per seat per month, and I anticipate that running a continuous on-call rotation will require a pool of at least four people.\n\nUpon passage of this proposal, $2400 will be allotted to the Security Workstream at the rate of $600\/month for the next 6 months. The Security Workstream will request renewal of this allocation as required via its ordinary budget process.\n\n### Bounty Committee\n\nBounty Committee members will be compensated at a rate of $150\/hour. Committee member workloads are estimated to be around 2-4 hours per month.\n\nUpon passage of this proposal, $25,200 will be allocated to the Security Workstream at the rate of $4200\/month for the next 6 months. The Security Workstream will request renewal of this allocation as required via its ordinary budget process.\n\n### De-minimis Bounties\n\nDe-minimis bounties will be 200 xDAI. (The centralized org used $50, which in my opinion is much too low and attracts the wrong caliber of researcher.) I believe that $200 is a rate that will make researchers feel appreciated and encourage their further engagement with the DAO, which is one of the program's goals; there's an aspect of paying for talent, or at least to attract *potential* talent.\n\nUpon passage of this proposal, 10,000 xDai will be allocated to the Security Workstream to fund these bounties; the Security Workstream will request any top-up funds required via its ordinary budget process.\n\n### Test funds \/ gas costs\n\nSetup and administration of the Hall of Fame will require funds in xDai for testing and gas to make the calls necessary to operate the contract. Upon passage of this proposal, 1000 xDai will be allotted to the Security Workstream for use as general testing\/gas funds. This will provide enough funds to perform full-scale testing and also cover the gas cost of operating the Hall of Fame contract for quite a while.\n\n## Voting\n\n- Yes: Establish the RDP and allocate funds as described.\n- No: Do nothing at this time.","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xA69c0339Ef7E34406C5bAd7F2DbD672a68b9338a","totalVotes":206,"blockNumber":13852025,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0xbba9b00b876633ce4c235729d05fefc51e4829c09b60d1784ee26fabd9f781c2","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640149200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1641013140}","startTimestamp":1640149200,"endTimestamp":1641013140,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 1873556.1, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1063.5017, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Specifically, the DAO would fund the reactor with up to $30 million worth of FOX from the DAO\u2019s treasury, and in return could generate a substantial revenue stream in the form of TOKE rewards.\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nThe ShapeShift DAO is sitting on a large amount of untapped potential in the form of its extensive FOX treasury (roughly $200 million at the time of this writing). Thanks to DeFi, there are myriad ways in which we can generate yield on those assets. That revenue, in turn, could potentially be used for treasury diversification and redistribution to FOX holders, and employed in other beneficial ways.\n\n(The ShapeShift treasury can be viewed here: https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x90a48d5cf7343b08da12e067680b4c6dbfe551be)\n\nWhat\u2019s the potential upside?\n\nAssuming current prices of FOX and TOKE, as well as an average Fox Reactor APR of 50% (currently it\u2019s at 43%), a deposit of $30 million worth of FOX (roughly 15% of the current treasury) would generate about $1.25 million in TOKE rewards per month. ($30 million at 50% = $15 mil\/yr or $1.25 mil\/mo)\n\nTOKE also potentially bears significant value to ShapeShift DAO as the governance token of the Tokemak protocol, which is used to allocate both TOKE rewards and vault liquidity, helping secure deep FOX liquidity and offsetting the need for ongoing liquidity mining programs.\n\nFurther, TOKE rewards can also be staked for additional TOKE yield of 50%+ for maximum yield.\n\nWhat are the potential downsides and risks?\n\nDue to the \u201cbalancing game\u201d mechanics behind Tokemak, a sizable deposit of FOX would lead to a substantial decline in the reactor\u2019s APR for FOX rewards\u2013not great for those staking FOX in the pool. However, the very same balancing mechanics would likely lead to a recovery in that APR within a few days: when the APR on the FOX side of our reactor goes down from a large deposit, the APR on the TOKE side goes up, incentivizing the \u201crebalancing\u201d of the rewards. This, in turn, should encourage TOKE voters to balance out the reactor and bring rewards back up to match the deposit.\n\nWith respect to risks: in the worst-case scenario, a smart contract bug or exploit could completely drain our Tokemak reactor, leading to the loss of all of the DAO\u2019s reactor-held funds. While the DAO would live to fight another day, losing up to $30 million would certainly be an unwelcome development\u2013a setback in terms of both optics and almost certainly the short-term price of FOX.\n\nWhat exactly does this Proposal do?\n\nYES: Up to $30 million worth of FOX will be deposited into the FOX Tokemak reactor.\n\nNO: No action is taken.","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x2aEE43Ad9F94f320201A3eb990eD04f11Da9791d","totalVotes":199,"blockNumber":13845021,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0x69982f85952992dcef3c365cfbecfdb69ce59eb13dde4abca03ba68f63e09414","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640055600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1640660400}","startTimestamp":1640055600,"endTimestamp":1640660400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES: Deposit up to $30 million', 'NO: No action is taken']","results":"[{'total': 7396912.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 102066.695, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Establishing this workstream includes the designation of Toasty and Hunt as collaborative workstream leaders, while further establishing TheSmith and LPX as co-leaders of the globalization\/translation initiative. The proposal will furthermore fund the inclusion of an additional 11 members: 5 current LatAM contributors, 3 globalization translators (Japanese, Korean, & French, with Chinese as a stretch goal in this four month term), and 3 contributors engaging in the development and deployment of the ShapeShift DAO Education project. \n\n\nAbstract\n\nToasty: Co-lead & manage the growth workstream and its strategies in outside partnerships and integrations. This includes overseeing and managing the public voice and branding of the DAO and it\u2019s community presence, as well as leading internal integration strategies, DAO event coordination and cross-stream collaboration. It is an inherent responsibility of this role to function effectively as a leader in growth, branding, partnerships, event coordination, globalization, and information workstream\/project efforts. \n\nHunt: Co-lead providing full support as-needed for the entirety of the workstreams directive both in strategizing and implementation of the growth and globalization\u2019s workstream responsibilities and projects. This includes functioning effectively as a leader in growth, branding, partnerships, globalization, and information project efforts. \n\nTheSmith: Leader of LatAM Labs, and co-lead of globalization, TheSmith will focus on strategizing with hunt and toasty to develop and deploy branding and growth frameworks targeting Latin American demographics. \n\nLPX: Co-Leader of Globalization providing full support to document repository infrastructure hosted here: https:\/\/docs.shapeshift.one\/. Furthermore, it is LPX\u2019s responsibility to manage the development and execution of French, Japanese, and Chinese language (as a stretch goal) translation bounties.\n\n\nMotivation \n\nAs the DAO grows, the requirement for a branding and partnership focused growth initiative continues to grow as well. Providing assistance in Globalization and LatAM Labs development while focusing on its most successful projects\/assets\/contributors already in place provides newly-formed efficiency in strategizing human capital allocation. By combining the globalization workstream with a newly formed growth, partnership & event coordination workstream, the current workstream contributors in existing workflows will experience an ease of contribution not possible with the present lack of workstream structure and management surrounding the initiatives defined in this proposal.\n\nWhile FOX token reaches new and varied markets and the DAO continues to seek worldwide opportunities for partnerships and innovation, a dedicated team is required to better seek, acquire, and develop new branding and partnership opportunities as well as strengthening our current user knowledge base. The need for dedicated oversight and leadership to refine and strengthen growth opportunities is vital to the continued success of the DAO\u2019s collective efforts. \n\nScope:\n\nBy establishing a dedicated workstream to focus on the growth, branding, partnerships, globalization, and information\/project scope of DAO efforts, we resolve the need for the expansion team required to develop more partner integrations, drive an increase in globalization, and start a new DAO education sector. \n\nGoals\/KPIs:\n\nDocument listing out goals and KPIs for the workstream.

This proposal both hires following contributors: Leadership (Toasty & Hunt), Global (LPX & FireBomb), LatAM (TheSmith, jpanam, mr bear, rohek, guilherme & vlad), and Information (ShapeShift DAO Education Project; @JessOtterlyHopeful, @DavidRAllen, @IrohDW), and funds the workstream and its projects with $249,000 USD in FOX.\n\nGrowth and Globalization Budget: \nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1v1eIjMCPTpog0ApGVb5M8xgg0jx2rNlejStpFA_LUpQ - All unused funds will be returned to the treasury.\n\nThe following link details Globalization accomplishments, blockers, and infrastructure overview and provides insight into the projected goals and roadmap of the workstream moving forward: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/15p7nTS3zBtGrVAHF3xt_9XP69k7FhIv59Qf0H-5STeQ\/ \n\nDeveloping an effective globalization effort through engaging in Latin American focused marketing efforts enables the ShapeShift DAO to begin the process of brand establishment and growth initiatives in order to create a voice throughout Latin America for the ShapeShift brand. This initiative is invaluable as growth in adoption within the Latin American region has grown exponentially at a velocity that is currently unparalleled globally. Through engaging a demographic that ShapeShift has historically been unable to successfully market, the previously hindering barriers in serving LatAM demographics will be less significant. \n\nThe following links include the Latin American marketing roadmap, community notion, analytics, and project presentation slides:\n\nLatAM Presentation Slides Link: https:\/\/www.canva.com\/design\/DAEwIdJix1Q\/4sIGciDNZ5-ve3zW_B3Tsg\/view?website#2:latam-pmo-proposal\n\nLatAM Roadmap Link: https:\/\/nonstop-lilac-1fd.notion.site\/Latam-Builders-12a98ced1c00491d8cf15895a7fef265\n\nLatAM Analytics Link: https:\/\/nonstop-lilac-1fd.notion.site\/LatAm-KPI-s-bc32a1eb294a445da31260aac0cae0fa\n\nLatAM community notion: https:\/\/www.notion.so\/ShapeShift-DAO-Latam-25eb72575d7e48a6bafff4994b2defcc\n\n\nBenefits\n\nThis proposal creates a single, unified workstream that works under\/towards growth initiatives as defined in this proposal. Branding, globalization, and partnerships working together to create a unified approach in determining the best growth strategy will allow for an effective alignment in order to produce and maintain efficient growth-focused projects and partnerships.\n\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThis proposal will cost 249,000 USD in FOX across a four month period. This workstream merges previous work streams\/project leadership, which may require optimization of existing strategy and implementation\/optimization within the workstream and its projects (Globalization, LatAM labs, & ShapeShift DAO EDU Roadmap). \n\n","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xcb3ef6Cd3fceC94199Fc9127B9A7c5044e5c758F","totalVotes":192,"blockNumber":13851164,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0xc244de7f647ae173b64bcddf778014a74114f857b7e000ca2d240a5a20848386","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640129400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1640626200}","startTimestamp":1640129400,"endTimestamp":1640626200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes - Establish & Fund ', 'No - Do Not Establish & Fund']","results":"[{'total': 3366590.2, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 101994.85, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This would allow the FOX DAO to build a treasury of DAO owned buy-side liquidity and protect the $FOX price during a market crash.\n\nAbstract - Liquidity is the money made available for trading. Most approaches to market making and liquidity involve putting up $FOX tokens and a base asset (usually ETH) for sale. This works great when $ETH is going up in value versus the dollar but leaves the $FOX price exposed to drops in the value of $ETH versus the dollar. Only single-sided $oneFOX is added to the proposed $oneFOX-$FOX Angel Vault. This protects $FOX price against market corrections.\n\nMotivation - $FOX price would be better protected against bear markets without hurting the upside during a bull market.\n\nSpecification - Angel Liquidity Vaults are a Uniswap v3 liquidity management protocol that allows LPs to deposit single-sided assets into a Uni v3 pool. They combine the rewarding and simple experience of Uniswap V2 with the concentrated liquidity of Uniswap V3. They enable projects to build a treasury of project owned liquidity and everyday DeFi users to earn fees without needing to manage their pool positions.\n\nClick here to read the Ideation thread: https:\/\/forum.shapeshift.com\/t\/scp-49-launch-onefox-fox-angel-vault-official-ideation-thread\/905\n\nLiquidity may be added to the Angel Vault in the following ways:\n\n1. Direct deposits by the $FOX community treasury,\n2. Incentivizing deposits by LPs,\n3. Purchasing LP with programs such as Olympus Pro Bonds, and\/or\n4. Leveraging the assets backing $oneFOX to mint more $oneFOX and deposit it to the Angel Vault.\n\nThis liquidity should total a minimum of $2M $oneFOX to enable profitable rebalancing of the Angel Vault. $10M or more liquidity is recommended given FOX\u2019s large Uni V2 FOX-WETH pool. While several options are available, we propose the following to secure the initial liquidity:\n\n1. ShapeShift DAO mints $2,000,000 oneFOX (method of minting can be determined by TM&D committee, but may include acquiring stablecoins via Success Token sales, borrowing against FOX, leveraging existing stablecoin balances in the treasury, or potentially other means as long as they do not result in FOX sell pressure)\n2. Launch an Angel Vault farming program targeting $8M of additional liquidity for 6 months and a >50% APR including trading fees. Assuming an average APR from trading fees of ~35% (based on the results from the oneUNI\/ICHI angel vault), a conservative reward rate of 25% should be targeted. At current FOX price of ~$0.65, this translates to $1M of FOX rewards, or 1,538,461 FOX rewarded over a 6 month period.\n\nBenefits - ICHI\u2019s Angel Vaults are the easiest and most cost effective way for projects to increase their liquidity floor, enabling:\n\n1. LPs to earn more trading fees with less,\n2. Liquidity rewards to increase the amount of buy side liquidity without also incentivizing sell pressure,\n3. The inflationary cost of rewards to be offset by the deflationary minting of the project\u2019s branded dollar, and\n4. DAOs to build assets under management (AUM) backing their branded dollar and supplying DAO owned liquidity.\n\nDrawbacks - If $FOX price declines in value, $oneFOX will be sold for $FOX. LPs will only be holding worthless $FOX tokens if $FOX price goes to $0.","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x11111D16485aa71D2f2BfFBD294DCACbaE79c1d4","totalVotes":191,"blockNumber":13844950,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0x1c40ae413894b6990730505b9ad98610c3a9ac4f79c227165f70ec2ce610f1e5","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640044800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1640624400}","startTimestamp":1640044800,"endTimestamp":1640624400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Launch Angel Vault Program', 'Do Nothing']","results":"[{'total': 5012579.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 106585.81, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This version will have analytics and guided user journeys, A\/B testing, heatmaps and more (via Pendo), so that the product team can discover pain points, validate assumptions, and gather feedback to improve the experience, before releasing changes to the Private version. This will be a truly opt-in Alpha version, that users will agree to participate in upon entering. No PII data will ever be tracked, in fact, part of the agreement with Pendo is that we are not allowed to track any PII, and if we do they can terminate our account.\n\nThe Private version will have no analytics or user tracking of any sort and will contain features that have already been tested and analyzed in the Alpha version.\n\nMotivation:\n\nAfter a lot of feedback from the community about Analytics in the DAO, a new idea was born. As the Product Workstream, our goal is to make the best user experience possible and create the best products for the success of the DAO! As part of our process we rely on analytics & data to track feature adoption, inform new features or feature updates through data-driven decisions, understand areas of product friction and ensure tight product-market fit. The data helps us answer questions like where are our users navigating? What are\/aren\u2019t they adopting? Are the users starting a journey and then abandoning at a specific point? What are the points of friction? Does the user have a clear path if something goes wrong?\n\nAnd more. Therefore, we think that this early, first look Alpha version is critical to our success.\n\nWe also feel that by having two versions that are clearly labeled for the users, and the Alpha version being a true \u201copt-in\u201d experience, there would be no confusion at the user level as to the differences between them.\n\nIn centralized ShapeShift, we used a combination of analytical tools to track user data, create user segments, monitor funnels and more. In the DAO, it would save us costs and effort to implement one all-powerful tool like Pendo in the Alpha version. This also makes it more useful for our DAO structure (any team will be able to grab\/review data without dependencies on another team). Furthermore, Pendo will give us the ability to create user onboarding journeys, guided feature walk-thrus, a comprehensive user resource section, A\/B testing, heatmaps and more\u2014all without any engineering lift.\n\nSpecification\nAlpha & Private Versions\n\nThe Alpha version will simply be a step in the CI\/CD pipeline, almost like a staging environment. Once features have been launched, tested, updated and bugs eliminated, it will be pushed to the Private version.\n\nInstallation\n\nTo install Pendo, it\u2019s a snippet of code added to the website.\n\nMaintenance\n\nThe user guides, resource center and tooltip walk-thrus will be created and maintained by the Product Workstream. We also will save considerable development\/engineering time, as we won\u2019t be dependent on engineers to develop, update, or analyze these.\n\nReviewing Data\n\nAnalytics will be easily accessible by all workstreams in the DAO, and as a Product Workstream, we\u2019ll share progress and review analytics with the community.\n\nBudget\n\nPendo is an all-in-one tool that will save us money as we won\u2019t have to implement multiple tools to give us the same benefits. The annual cost for integrating it into the Alpha web app is\n\n$36,520.00 annually + $3,400 QuickStart (this will help us get up and running with the guides quickly) and will be paid to Pendo in FOX Tokens!\n\nBenefits\n\nThe Alpha version will give us the analytics and user input we need to make the product awesome before pushing it to the Private version.\n\nBy using Pendo, we\u2019ll have an all-in-one platform for tracking, analyzing, and creating guided user journeys (instead of paying for multiple platforms). We expect the initial setup to take several weeks to get all the guides and the resource center up and running. As mentioned above, all of that will be handled as part of the Product Workstream responsibilities. It will not require engineering efforts.\n\nRetention is an important metric, and one that can be improved by utilizing this approach. We\u2019ll be able to take our user experience to the next level, guiding and engaging our users at the right moments, leading to better feature engagement and higher user retention. Without the metrics we would have an extremely difficult time determining where to improve the UX and measuring the success of our product. New feature adoption rates will also be evaluated as a metric to measure success.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nPendo is not the cheapest solution out there. But, it\u2019s an all-inclusive solution where we feel the benefits outweigh the cost (especially if compared to pricing out several different tools that collectively would provide the same benefits). We\u2019d also be committing to an annual plan to get the best pricing.\n\nNote: MrNerdHair is currently reviewing the Pendo code.

Its implementation will be determined by each workstream leader.\n\n  Abstract \n[Coordinape](https:\/\/coordinape.com\/) is a bottom up payment system in which people are paid based on how their team feels about their contributions.\n\nEach payment period has a budget and a team of contributors. At the end of the payment period (usually monthly) the contributors have a set amount of GIVE tokens that they give to the team members they believe deserve it the most. Give tokens that are received are exchanged for a corresponding amount of the budget. A simple example would be a contributor with 10% of the total GIVE tokens and 10,000 FOX in the budget, then at the end of the payment period they receive 1000 FOX. Coordinape records and aggregates who is giving to who and what they are working on, which provides a lot of information that can be used to make the DAO more efficient.\n\n\n    Motivation\nWith the creation of DAOs, there is no limit to the freedom we have in how we incentivize contributors. One gap we have in our current system is that payment is routed through workstream leaders, which is top down. Adding a bottom up payment system in addition to the current one gives us more flexibility in how we organize ourselves to get tasks done. While Coordinape may not be ideal for all workstreams, having it as an option will certainly benefit the DAO as a whole.\n\n\n    Specification\nTo get workstreams started using this without constraining their budgets immediately, I request 100K FOX to create a Coordinape fund that will be divided relative to the budget size of each workstreams. E.g. if a workstream's budget is 10% of all workstreams, then they get 10% of this fund.\n\n\n    Benefits\nProvides a bottom up way to pay contributors\n\nThe community gets a lot of information about what contributors are doing and the value they bring the DAO.\n\n    Drawbacks\nRequires some time and energy to set up and adds additional complexity to our payment systems. \n\nCoordinape is paid by donations, so whatever we agree to give them is a cost on our treasury.\n\n\n    Compensation\nIf this proposal passes, I request 2000 FOX for setting it up. \n\n\n    Vote\nFor: \n1.

The Workstream is accountable for a number of activities which are critical to the DAO\u2019s ability to delight users, grow the FOX ecosystem, and achieve its mission. This is a proposal to continue funding the Product & Creative Services Workstream\u2019s anticipated budget through June 30, 2022.\n\nMotivation\n\nContinuing to fund this workstream will ensure that the ShapeShift DAO can retain the extraordinary talent that the Workstream already has while also ensuring the team can expand and fulfill the growing product, design and UX needs that the DAO\u2019s product development and creative requirements demand. The workstream has so far succeeded in hitting their goals, and has completed a large number of projects including the launch of the new responsive Alpha website and successful Yearn integration. We\u2019re also working on an updated proposal to implement analytics on an Alpha version of the web app (alpha.shapeshift.com) where new features will be released first. This will enable us to collect and report metrics to the community while still offering a private, analytics-free version of the app on app.shapeshift.com 1.

We\u2019d also like to make sure we remain agile\u2014understanding that new partnerships or new revenue generating Defi projects could be brought forward, and some of those could shift our current goals or bring new goals forward.

We have removed the Project Manager roles, as it currently stands, they are not immediately necessary. Should the need arise to add those or additional roles in the future, separate proposals will be made accordingly.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that Diggy was voted into the Workstream leadership role, through Feb 2022. If she plans to run for the Workstream leader position beyond that timeframe, she will make a separate proposal later on.\n\nIf this proposal passes, most of this budget will be distributed in stable coin going forward. The equivalent amount of USDC & a small portion in FOX will be transferred from the DAO\u2019s treasury to the Product Workstream on Colony on a monthly basis. (Because FOX is a volatile asset, any decreases in FOX price will warrant additional transfers of FOX from the DAO to the Product Workstream on Colony to ensure the Workstream has enough FOX to cover its budget). All unused funds will be returned to the DAO.\n\nBenefits\n\nIf this proposal passes, the DAO will receive the following specific deliverables and services which are integral to its success:\n\n\u2022 Proposed feature roadmap encompassing the following products the DAO: ShapeShift Mobile, current web app (beta.shapeshift.com), new open-source web app, shapeshift.com, and other products the ShapeShift DAO launches\n\n\u2022 Feature specs for prioritized features including goals, success metrics, and acceptance criteria\n\n\u2022 UI\/UX for each prioritized feature\n\n\u2022 Front-end development\n\n\u2022 Reporting on product KPIs and feature success metrics (once Analytics are in place)\n\n\u2022 Design-oriented and brand-focused creative support, guidelines, and guardrails to the myriad of projects the DAO will take on\n\nDrawbacks\n\nThe main potential risk is whether cost\/benefit of a product workstream will be worth it to the DAO\u2019s bottom-line in the long term. To mitigate this risk, only 6 months of funding are being requested. The funds will be managed on Colony and can be revoked by the DAO in a worst-case-scenario.\n\nVote\n\nFOR: You support funding the workstream\u2019s anticipated 2022 budget for 6 months totaling $686,049\n\nAGAINST: You do not support continuing to fund the product workstream","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9304b785e517b8644fCf6F2a12dD05877BC035E2","totalVotes":112,"blockNumber":13811651,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0xbd6b30d7ecd640facbd4f8869c6dd23f1eec51d64650ee07b75a03af056362b6","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639597500}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1640115900}","startTimestamp":1639597500,"endTimestamp":1640115900,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['FOR', 'AGAINST']","results":"[{'total': 4505109.5, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

The goal of this proposal is to enumerate the reasons why, and the resources required to make it a reality.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nCurrently, the Shapeshift DAO depends on infrastructure provided by Shapeshift AG in order to bootstrap hardware for its next-generation defi software platform to operate. If the DAO is to become independent and self-sufficient, it will need to appoint one or more trusted proxies to operate its own infrastructure. Shapeshift AG is dissolving, and if a new arrangement is not made, the DAO will eventually have no assets on which to run its platform or development environments. As the primary function of the DAO is to produce a software product, this initiative is integral for the long-term ability of the DAO to function and survive at a very basic level.\n\n**Specification**\n\nWe are proposing that the Shapeshift DAO enables itself to independently serve its own product to the world via leveraging its existing relationship with TaxiStake. TaxiStake is a legal US commercial entity already tooled for operating in this capacity, and currently runs a Cosmos Validator on behalf of the DAO. As such, there are no initial capital expenditures required to fund the project.\n\nThe DAO\u2019s next-gen defi platform, referred to as \u201cShapeshift Web v2\u201d, pulls its data from a piece of back-end software, named \u201cUnchained\u201d. Unchained initially pivots on offering a rich user experience with the Ethereum ecosystem via the Geth blockchain client running in full archive mode. This means that the Geth implementation is demanding in both storage and run-time resources. As a result, the initial footprint of a new Unchained cluster running Ethereum is about $1000 USD a month. Thankfully, this initial cluster footprint will also be powerful enough to run a few additional, less-demanding blockchain clients such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Thorchain, without incurring additional cost to the operator.\n\nThis proposal posits that:\n\n* TaxiStake will provision an isolated, dedicated cloud provider account for running the DAO\u2019s infrastructure. No services will be provisioned in this account that do not belong to the DAO.\n* TaxiStake itself will not be responsible for on-call or triage of operational issues with the software.\n* TaxiStake will delegate privileged access to the cluster and\/or account for appropriate members of the Engineering Workstream who are responsible for on-call and triage of operational issues.\n* TaxiStake will provide programmatic access to the account in order to deploy assets via automated CI\/CD workflows.\n* The instance of Unchained operated by TaxiStake will become the primary back-end leveraged by Shapeshift Web v2.\n* A Sablier stream will be established, from which TaxiStake can be reimbursed at a 150% rate for monthly operational expenditures incurred in running this infrastructure for three months. This equates to about $500 USD a month in profit for TaxiStake itself. If this arrangement needs to be terminated or modified for any reason, the DAO can simply withdraw or reissue the stream\u2019s contract. This arrangement will be renewed on a quarterly basis unless otherwise modified by governance.\nThe relationship with TaxiStake will continue to be leveraged for future infrastructure needs, assuming all goes well. At present, this is expected to include future blockchain integrations in the Unchained back-end, but could be extended to new feature offerings.\n\n**Motivation\/Benefits**\n\nAs mentioned previously, the DAO currently depends on Shapeshift AG to provide hardware to run its software product. The primary motivation of this proposal is to enable the DAO to serve its own product to the world with its own infrastructure.\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\nIt does increase the DAO\u2019s reliance on the relationship with TaxiStake. However, the infrastructure deployment workflow is currently packaged in such a way that if the relationship with TaxiStake needs to be terminated for some reason, it is a fairly simple process to deploy these assets elsewhere under the auspices of a new arrangement.\n\nAdditionally, the Foundation will be running an Unchained endpoint for the foreseeable future, and Shapeshift Web v2 can be quickly reconfigured to use it within a matter of minutes should need arise.\n\n**Vote**\n\nIf you vote \u201cFor\u201d this proposal, you are endorsing the following points:\n\n* The DAO should be capable of running its own infrastructure to serve its own product,\n* TaxiStake is a trusted proxy able to run the DAO\u2019s infrastructure in a reliable and secure fashion,\n* The establishment and funding of a Sablier contract in the amount of $4500 USD in DAI stablecoin tokens (1 DAI = 1 USD) to serve as a reimbursement vector for TaxiStake\u2019s operational expenditures over the course of three months.\n\nIf you vote \u201cAgainst\u201d, you are indicating that you do not want the DAO to be able to run its own infrastructure, or perhaps just not via the existing relationship with TaxiStake.","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x52610eeD04D9ba715020693c6A515f27c845B625","totalVotes":115,"blockNumber":13773903,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/Qmc2p69u7sr1RGA8ofBgLTgFQ5AacjTiojUQcJwTRASccC","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1639152000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639800021}","startTimestamp":1639152000,"endTimestamp":1639800021,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 4695586.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 160, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

These C.o.R.E. 2 Reactor bribes provided incentivization for TOKE voters to decide which project\/coin would secure a reactor. Without said bribes FOX would very likely not have secured\/won a reactor (requiring top 5) during the C.o.R.E. 2 vote.\n\nAbstract: During the voting process, FOX token did not seem to be in a position to win with the level of incentivization provided by the community leading into the final day\/hours of the vote (as can be seen in this thread where we were #8 with 15 hours to go: https:\/\/forum.shapeshift.com\/t\/tokemak-c-o-r-e-2-solution). The only idea\/solution that the community could agree upon at the time within the ShapeShift DAO discord, was that we would all support a future vote to refund FOX bribers; if we were to plea to the community\/FOX holders. Thankfully after I made this post in an attempt to rally the community, numerous FOX holders stepped up to the plate in the interest of the DAO, selflessly increasing the amount of FOX in our C.o.R.E. 2 bribe pool.\n\nMotivation: The benefits of having a TOKEMAK reactor are vast and provide the DAO with not only new tokenomics related capability, but in community growth, exposure to new potential users, and so much more. What the community members did that stepped up to the plate and secured this C.o.R.E. 2 reactor is effectively heroic in my opinion, and for the aforementioned reasons I am dedicated to following up on the suggestion that we refund these heros.\n\nSpecification: This proposal passing provides a refund in the amount of 1295964.93 FOX, which will be paid out to 9 addresses (from 14 transactions). The addresses collected were provided by @CollFoxyPrincess (on discord) to myself @huntthewick (@hunt on discord). They have also been fact-checked by myself (@huntthewick), @collfoxyprincess, and @jonisjon. Furthermore, these payments are to be directed and executed by the Treasury\u2019s multi-sig signers if this proposal is to pass.\n\nBenefits: We have secured a highly sought after TOKEMAK reactor due to the selfless and honorable acts of numerous FOX holders\/community members. This refund provides them assurance that this community will do the right thing in providing a refund to holders that wish to see our DAO grow in strength and capability; two things that a TOKEMAK reactor will bring to FOX token & our DAO as a whole.\n\nDrawbacks: We will be distributing 1295964.93 FOX from the treasury; this is an expense which decreases total treasury holdings.","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xcb3ef6Cd3fceC94199Fc9127B9A7c5044e5c758F","totalVotes":126,"blockNumber":13714308,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0x3bc85d91698bd39e417f849c8dad2740c4be0e9456b858261284b0184507eb9b","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638270000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1638702000}","startTimestamp":1638270000,"endTimestamp":1638702000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES - REFUND BRIBES', 'NO - DO NOT REFUND BRIBES']","results":"[{'total': 4061781.5, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 9085.766, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

The purpose of the Creative Services Group is to make creative content in alignment with the ShapeShift brand.\n\nABSTRACT:\nThis group is proposed to be a new squad within the Product Workstream, resulting in a slight expansion of the responsibilities handled by Products to encompass design services for other workstreams. My proposed role is to be Director of Creative Services, as a new full-time member of the Product Workstream, and squad leader of Creative Services Group.\n\nMOTIVATION:\nCompanies in the crypto space are highly brand-focused: SushiSwap, Olympus, Maker DAO, etc. Sustaining ShapeShift\u2019s strong aesthetic and branding guideline is essential in pushing forward as an industry leader.\n\nThe mission of Creative Services is to provide design-oriented and brand-focused creative support, guidelines, and guardrails to the myriad of projects the DAO will take on. This includes internal projects from workstream members, bountied designers, and content creators from the community.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\nThe focus of this squad is to help all ShapeShift workstreams communicate effectively, supported by engaging content that is aligned with the brand of ShapeShift DAO. This support can come in the form of:\n\nProduct marketing management\nProduct launch process management\nGraphic design services\n2D\/3D animation\nGIF \/ Sticker creation for Discord \/ GIPHY \/ Tenor\nVideo production\nCreative writing\nProducer services:\nStory visualization\nScript services\nVideo translation production\nClosed \/ Open Captioning\nTalent coordination and management\nInstructional design\nCreative project management\nNFT creation & sales\n\nIt is anticipated that the production needs will be handled by myself for these first 6 months, and by bounties when additional production support is needed. I will serve as a project manager and designer, also function as a group manager to coordinate and curate design talent for future projects, as we look toward expansion.\n\nHoff remains the ShapeShift brand director and Diggy will continue to serve as the Director of the Product Workstream, to whom the Creative Services Group will report.\n\nBENEFITS\nAn all-encompassing design group allows ShapeShift to be competitive within the crypto ecosystem, projecting a polished, professional image in all that we DAO. Every product we make should have a compelling story and visual identity that resonates with the community.\n\nAs a part of Product Workstream, we can provide product launch services to effectively inform and delight customers as new products come to fruition. As we move further into decentralization and open-source, the community will continue to drive so much more of our future. It is imperative to take charge of our image, establishing boundaries for new designers that want to be ShapeShift DAO contributors.\n\nA Creative Services Group allows me to do what I\u2019ve been doing for the last few months: design, animation, video, and much more. However, I get to do this unfettered from the burden of holding two jobs simultaneously, or without having to budget bounties for every small job.\n\nBUDGET\nNOTE: This proposal is for a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d in launching the group in 2022, and for the creation of the role. The budget will be approved with the renewal of the Product Workstream.\n\nThe budget for this squad will add $122,000 to the Product & Design Workstream over the next 6 months, covering some initial equipment costs, salary, utilities, stock elements, and additional expenses such as bountied design services, trade shows\/conferences, and benefits. I anticipate the first two months being a phase-out of my previous job, overlapping one full month and a perhaps second month of contracting with my previous employer. Details will be disclosed in the Product and Design Workstream proposal.\n\nNon-salary items that go unused (stock elements, bounties, conferences) will go back to the DAO.\n\nDRAWBACKS\nThe only drawback I see is cost.

These discussions are already bearing fruit (for instance, around the creation of a treasury management committee), but could benefit from additional structure and strategic direction.\n\nFollowing community approval of this proposal, a tokenomics Workstream would be created, existing alongside other workstreams in ShapeShift\u2019s org chart. The workstream\u2019s leader would be Kent, this proposal\u2019s author. The tokenomics leader would be tasked with bringing clarity to the current ambiguous structure and strategy, as well as providing guidance and direction to other community members operating in the workstream.\n\nMOTIVATION:\n\nTokenomics is the lifeblood of most successful DAO\u2019s. When a DAO has its own token (a governance token, in the case of ShapeShift), it unlocks a host of exciting possibilities, including:\n\nFunding for the DAO via its treasury\nSustainable business models that were previously not possible\nValue-accrual mechanisms for holders of the token, of which a subset are users of the ShapeShift platform\nClearly defining the Tokenomics Workstream and a cohesive strategy will enable the ShapeShift DAO and FOX Token to achieve its greatest potential. The current workstream, operating as a placeholder until something official could be built out, has already made great strides in terms of a.) engaging community members and b.) contributing to discussions and decision-making around topics such as treasury management and engagement with novel DeFi protocols.\n\nIn light of the progress that\u2019s already been achieved without a fully-funded and clearly-defined Tokenomics Workstream, it\u2019s easy to imagine how much could be accomplished once these elements are in place. Equally important, a workstream budget would incentivize more community members to spend their time, effort, and brainpower on these issues. Additionally, these economic incentives might also bring invaluable new talent to the DAO.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS:\n\nThe Tokenomics Workstream will focus on two broad questions:\n\nHow should the DAO manage its treasury?\nHow will value accrue to FOX and holders of the token?\nWhat are the core responsibilities of the Tokenomics Workstream Leader?\n\n1.) Define the strategic goals of the Workstream.\n\n2.) Build a team of contributors who can help make those goals a reality.\n\n3.) Work alongside that team as the Workstream devises and employs the tactics necessary to achieve its goals.\n\n4.) Revisit and revise the strategic direction as necessary.\n\nWhat constitutes success?\n\nFor this first four-mouth term, initial deliverables will include:\n\n1.) Creating a \u201cState of the FOX\u201d snapshot that provides an updated view of our treasury, current partnerships, and value-accrual strategies. With a clear picture of where we are now, we\u2019ll be better-positioned to execute on our strategic objectives.\n\n2.) Creating strategic treasury management diversification goals, for consideration by the Treasury Management Committee.\n\n3.) Diversification of the treasury (pending Committee approval).\n\n4.) Building a team of tokenomics contributors.\n\n5.) Contributing to the creation of new value-accrual mechanisms for FOX.\n\nVoting \"YES\" does the following: \n\n 1.) Create the Tokenomics Workstream as described above. 2.) Install Kent as the Workstream Leader. 3.) Fund the Tokenomics Workstream with $95,500 through March 31st, 2022.","protocol":"shapeshift","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xE56Edf928D813cA9D0530e6Bc893029E07C683C6","totalVotes":149,"blockNumber":13641216,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/shapeshiftdao.eth\/proposal\/0xb55e807f860a5eef0e1a8475e6c3c52e040913d7526823d25ebc2954ced83684","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637271900}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637876700}","startTimestamp":1637271900,"endTimestamp":1637876700,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES: Make the proposed changes', 'NO: Make no changes']","results":"[{'total': 4477108, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 200, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This will divert a portion of trading fees (100% - payout ratio) from xSUSHI stakers to the Treasury as revenue denominated in a reserve asset, e.g. ETH or DAI. At a payout ratio of 90%, xSUSHI holders are paid out 90% of the 5bps, or 4.5bps, and the remaining 0.5bps are sent to the treasury as retained earnings. Introducing retained earnings will offer valuable bear market protection as well as allow SUSHI holders to govern a new cash flow, which could be used to reinvest in growth or generate non-operating income.\n\nSummary\nWritten by Yuan Han Li and Aleks Larsen (@aleks-bcap) on behalf of Blockchain Capital\n\nAs recent market dynamics have shown, crypto-asset prices remain highly volatile and we should expect this to be the case for the foreseeable future. Sushi\u2019s treasury is currently denominated entirely in SUSHI, and while this provides great upside for the treasury, it also leaves the treasury vulnerable in the event of market dislocations. Since the treasury has no income other than SUSHI emissions (which will end in 2-3 years), and since operational expenses are incurred in USD terms, the treasury might be forced to pay expenses by selling SUSHI in a prolonged bear market (=bad for token price, bad for our Master Chefs, and bad for xSUSHI stakers at the SushiBar).\n\nThus, as SUSHI holders, if we want to continue enjoying delicious SUSHI at the SushiBar by staking xSUSHI, it is important that we show appreciation to our hardworking Master Chefs by making sure they have an income model that is sustainable longer-term. Traditionally, when eating at a sushi bar, one way to do this is by offering the hardworking chefs some sake and saying \u201cKanpai!\u201d. In our case, we can support the hardworking Master Chefs of the Sushi ecosystem in perpetuity by introducing a \u2018payout ratio 3\u2019 to start retaining some earnings in the treasury.\n\nThe \u2018payout ratio\u2019 is a parameter that corporations typically have which determines how much of their net income is distributed to shareholders as dividends vs how much is retained in their treasury for reinvestment purposes. Normally, high-growth companies are able to re-invest at a high rate of return, and for that reason, they typically choose to set the payout ratio to 0 until they can no longer find productive ways to reinvest the capital. We think this concept is extremely useful and should be a governance-controlled parameter for Sushi holders to determine and change over time.\n\nHigh-level contours of our proposal:\n\nOur suggested approach is to divert a portion of trading fees determined by a new parameter, \u2018payout ratio,\u2019 into a reserve asset (e.g. ETH\/USDC\/DAI\/USDT\/WBTC) and send it to the Treasury as retained earnings that governance can decide what to do with. For example, if the payout ratio were set to 90%, this would mean that 10% (0.5bps) of the 5bps currently earned by xSUSHI holders as dividends would instead be sent directly to the treasury.\nUsing total fees generated in the last 30 days ($74.56mm), the Treasury could have generated ~$1.24mm in revenue (@ a payout ratio of 90%), which annualizes to nearly ~$15.12mm.\n\nCurrently, the Treasury\u2019s only income stream is SUSHI block emissions, but SUSHI will reach its supply cap in the next 2-3 years, so this is not a long term solution. Moreover, the vast majority of Sushi\u2019s operational expenses are incurred in USD terms, so block emissions and existing SUSHI held in the treasury cannot be used to meet expenses without being sold.\n\nAlthough the ~$616.7k worth of stablecoin\/ETH in the Sushi Dev Fund and the $2.5mm in stablecoin\/ETH\/BTC from the sushiHOUSE proposal is a good start to diversifying the Treasury, ~$3.12mm in non-SUSHI assets where >50% is held in ETH\/BTC could still prove to be insufficient to meet all operational expenses if BTC\/ETH experiences another multi-year bear market like in 2018-19. If this occurs, the Treasury might be forced to sell SUSHI at very low prices to meet operational expenses, which would then cause a further downward spiral in SUSHI prices. It is thus paramount for the Sushi community to expand current Treasury Diversification efforts, and ideally find a Treasury Management solution that:\n\nWill have minimal, and ideally no impact, on SUSHI price.\nIs low risk (the DAO could choose to collateralize Treasury SUSHI for a stablecoin loan, offering liquidity without selling SUSHI, but this has the potential to go very very wrong\u2014especially without any Treasury income).\nCan generate sufficient amounts of revenue to always cover operational expenses.\n\nAs a bonus, can generate income in excess of yearly expenses so that leftover profit can be used to expand the current Treasury diversification efforts and further protect the Treasury\u2019s asset base in the event of a bear market (i.e. use excess income to Yield farm, stake ETH with Lido\/RocketPool, lend stablecoin on Aave\/Compound\/Cream, invest\/do token-swaps with strategically aligned protocols like Yearn, buyback SUSHI, etc.).\n\nSpecification\nSushi currently charges traders 30bps on all trades: 25bps goes to LPs and the other 5bps is reserved as fees until someone generously chooses to serve it up as SUSHI to xSUSHI stakers in the SushiBar. With this take rate, in the last 30 days, the total fees generated for LPs and xSUSHI holders was $74.56mm; annualizing this figure gets us to ~$907.15mm.\n\nWe propose the introduction of a \u2018payout ratio\u2019 on the 5bps currently sent to xSUSHI stakers (to be set to 90% initially). Concretely, this means 0.5bps would be reserved by the protocol as Treasury income and be served up as ETH\/USDC\/DAI\/USDT\/WBTC to the Treasury with the remaining 4.5bps going to xSUSHI stakers as SUSHI. If the \u2018payout ratio\u2019 had been set to 90% previously, the Treasury would have generated ~$1.24mm in the last 30 days, which annualizes to nearly ~$15.12mm in income.\n\nImplementation:\nCurrently, when SUSHI is served to the SushiBar (through the SushiMaker.sol or SushiMakerKashi.sol contract), tokens reserved as fees are removed from the liquidity pool, swapped into WETH, and then finally swapped from WETH into SUSHI and \u2018served up\u2019 to the SushiBar (e.g. DAI and USDC reserved as fees on SushiSwap are removed from the USDC-DAI liquidity pool, swapped into WETH, then into SUSHI and served to the SushiBar). One possible way, then, to send the 0.25bps of fees allocated to the Sushi Treasury might be to modify _convertStep within SushiMaker.sol and SushiMakerKashi.sol to:\n\nConclusion:\nThe Treasury\u2019s current near 100% SUSHI allocation could prove to be risky in the event a prolonged bear market occurs, so the Treasury is in need of expanding its ongoing diversification efforts. By creating a new governance-controlled \u2018payout ratio\u2019 parameter, to be initially set to 90%, 0.5bps of the 5bps of the fee revenue currently paid to xSUSHI stakers will be sent to the Treasury instead. This gives the Treasury enough revenue every year to cover operational expenses and also an ample surplus to invest in low-risk assets to further diversify the Treasury and bring in non-operating income (e.g. by yield farming, providing liquidity on SushiSwap, staking ETH).\n\nInitial Parameters (based on community voting):\nPayout Ratio would be 95%\nIncome Denomination WETH+Stablecoin (50\/50)\n","protocol":"sushi","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x285b7EEa81a5B66B62e7276a24c1e0F83F7409c1","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":12972849,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/sushigov.eth\/proposal\/QmTPHMTnkvJRXZ1szsZxDjQGCm89ze7z31RMHoveBFmzpD","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1628362800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1628708400}","startTimestamp":1628362800,"endTimestamp":1628708400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes -  \u662f\u7684 - \u306f\u3044', 'No - \u4e0d -  \u3044\u3044\u3048']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

With reward vesting removed we are seeing increased selling pressure for SUSHI, making yield less attractive for liquidity providers.\n\nHistory:\n\nSushi started with Discord voting to decide which pairs should receive incentives and moved into a more opaque model decided by the core team. There are two problems: \n1) emission has limited quid pro quo in terms of fees vs emission, and \n2) Sushi is submerged by Onsen listing requests.\n\nSolution\nWe believe that curve.finance, through its veCRV token, has built one of the best token designs in the space for emission-based projects.\n\nFollowing veCRV and DILL from pickle.finance to direct emissions, we propose SushiSwap deploys oSushi (OnsenSushi), developed by Curve, myself, and Pickle team, and having been audited 4 times across 3 different firms.\n\noSushi can be used as a minimum pre-requisite for projects to stake oSushi to be come eligible for voting gauges on the onsen interface.\n\nOnce available, oSushi can be used to vote weights, replacing current allocation points.

This update is particularly beneficial for subgraph\/app developers who do the first signal.\n\n## Implementation\nUse a Minimal Proxy to clone the Graph Curation Token (ERC20) based on an implementation contract deployed just once. The implementation bytecode is also called master copy.\n\nThe benefit of this solution is that the token interface remain the same, making it backwards compatible.\n\nThis solution involves the following changes:\n\n- Modify the initializer of Curation to accept the master copy contract address to use when cloning.\n- Expose a function in Curation contract so that governance can change the implementation in the future.\n- Leverage \"@openzeppelin\/contracts\/proxy\/Clones.sol\" to spawn the Minimal Proxies.\n- Update the current Graph Curation Token contract code and make it upgradeable so it can be used from the context of a Minimal Proxy.\n\n\n## References\n\nImplementations: https:\/\/github.com\/graphprotocol\/contracts\/pull\/505\n\nAudit: https:\/\/github.com\/graphprotocol\/contracts\/blob\/a24f6a140ad170cfc11572136e309c70975b8a2a\/audits\/OpenZeppelin\/2021-11-graph-curation-minimal-proxy.pdf\n\n---\n\n# Graph Governance Proposal-0009\n## Save gas when initializing a subgraph deployment\nThis proposal is to upgrade The Graph's protocol smart contracts running on Ethereum mainnet with the changes described in Graph Improvement Proposal (GIP) 0019, including the motivation and scope of the changes described in this proposal.\n\nThe code deployed that implements GIP-0019 must correspond to the commit hash included in the front matter of this governance proposal.\n\nFollowing a successful \"yes\" vote, the protocol upgrade should be carried out at the earliest convenience using The Graph Council's Gnosis Multisig.\n","protocol":"thegraphcouncil","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x7EbE5983FDA73749f94E39A215Cc80263A280385","totalVotes":6,"blockNumber":13728686,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/council.graphprotocol.eth\/proposal\/0x02fd3223ede7e0ea8be36fb2e22abd7b41ae9441ade0edf83d600b8becaf2a68","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638442800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1638874800}","startTimestamp":1638442800,"endTimestamp":1638874800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 6, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Then, they want indexers to run their subgraphs in the decentralized network. To achieve that, they publish a Subgraph in the GNS that targets a Subgraph Deployment. Once they publish a subgraph, they work to attract curators that delegate signal to the Subgraph so that the app developer can properly incentivize indexers.\n\nFor many reasons, the app developer might want to transfer ownership of the subgraph to a different account, a valid use case, not possible with the current implementation.\n\n## Implementation\nThe proposed implementation involves a number of changes to make it easier to manage a subgraph. In addition to that, it simplifies many of the contract interfaces. The following bullet points provide a summary of the implementation areas:\n- Subgraph Primary Key\n- NFT-based Ownership\n- Interface Simplification\n- Remove Unused Functionality\n- Migration Facilities\n\nDetails of the implementation are captured in the Implementations link.\n\n## References\n\nImplementations: https:\/\/github.com\/graphprotocol\/contracts\/pull\/497\n\nAudit: https:\/\/github.com\/graphprotocol\/contracts\/blob\/4ec06e9357c948829e72c3a4c9ed8bfc1d0d04ba\/audits\/OpenZeppelin\/2021-11-graph-gns-transferrable-owner.pdf\n\n---\n\n# Graph Governance Proposal-0008\n\n## Subgraph ownership transfer\nThis proposal is to upgrade The Graph's protocol smart contracts running on Ethereum mainnet with the changes described in Graph Improvement Proposal (GIP) 0018, including the motivation and scope of the changes described in this proposal.\n\nThe code deployed that implements GIP-0018 must correspond to the commit hash included in the front matter of this governance proposal.\n\nFollowing a successful \"yes\" vote, the protocol upgrade should be carried out at the earliest convenience using The Graph Council's Gnosis Multisig.\n","protocol":"thegraphcouncil","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x7EbE5983FDA73749f94E39A215Cc80263A280385","totalVotes":6,"blockNumber":13728657,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/council.graphprotocol.eth\/proposal\/0xaaa3183b018252e69120be53c696d2c53ab52f455b3be5bb658e4b47d1c71aa1","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638442800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1638874800}","startTimestamp":1638442800,"endTimestamp":1638874800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 6, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

As many subgraph developers initially signaled ~100K GRT when using the network, the cost of upgrading a subgraph currently sits around 2.5K GRT. This cost is in addition to the opportunity cost of locking up the signal as well as the cost of actually paying for query fees.\n\n## References\n\nEconomic Attack Evaluation:\nThe major constraint of lowering the curation tax was evaluated in Appendix A of GIP-0013, which is referred to as Subgraph Withholding Attack\n\nCommunity Polls:\nhttps:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/graphprotocol.eth\/proposal\/QmRz29aE4TXpi9HrNbn6ZA1sRF1xEBeGbw8HxRpHZRZ4rD\n\nAudit:\nThe code that implements the curation tax has already been audited as a part of previous audits.

Today, that\u2019s only possible by using a Multisig or any other contract to batch those transactions.\n \nThis proposal allows batching transactions on the GNS, based on the Multicall pattern seen in Uniswap (https:\/\/github.com\/Uniswap\/uniswap-v3-periphery\/blob\/main\/contracts\/base\/Multicall.sol) and recently implemented in OpenZeppelin (https:\/\/docs.openzeppelin.com\/contracts\/4.x\/api\/utils#Multicall)\n \n## Implementation\nA new contract called MultiCall is introduced, inspired by the one used by Uniswap. The payable keyword was removed from the multicall() as the protocol does not deal with ETH. Additionally, it is insecure in some instances if the contract relies on msg.value.\n \nThe GNS inherits from MultiCall that expose a public multicall(bytes[] calldata data) function that receives an array of payloads to send to the contract itself. This allows to batch ANY publicly callable contract function.\nClient-side one can build such payloads like:\n \n\/\/ Build payloads\nconst tx1 = await gns.populateTransaction.publishNewSubgraph(\n    <subgraphAccount>,\n    <subgraphDeploymentID>,\n    <versionMetadata>,\n    <subgraphMetadata>,\n)\nconst tx2 = await gns.populateTransaction.mintNSignal(\n    <subgraphAccount>,\n    <subgraphNumber>,\n    <amount>,\n    <signalOut>,\n)\n \n\/\/ Send batch\nawait gns.multicall([tx1.data, tx2.data])\n \n \n \n## References\nImplementation: https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x8F0031C8A936e3f78Db1E0670135CCad27E5b689#code\nAudit: https:\/\/github.com\/graphprotocol\/contracts\/blob\/40a2a721e1b8441a76a8f7105ffd9577cd163fc6\/audits\/OpenZeppelin\/the-graph-gns-audit-2021-08.pdf\n \n \n \n---\n \n# Graph Governance Proposal-0005\n \n## Batch GNS transactions\n \nThis proposal is to upgrade The Graph's protocol smart contracts running on Ethereum mainnet with the changes described in Graph Improvement Proposal (GIP) 0014, including the motivation and scope of the changes described in this proposal.\n \nThe code deployed that implements GIP-0014 must correspond to the commit hash included in the front matter of this governance proposal.\n \nFollowing a successful \"yes\" vote, the protocol upgrade should be carried out at the earliest convenience using The Graph Council's Gnosis Multisig.\n\n","protocol":"thegraphcouncil","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x4530aFEaDe76579f4D4E6fF9e079520B7e7ebA9A","totalVotes":6,"blockNumber":13184611,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/council.graphprotocol.eth\/proposal\/Qma8hiZZrH8Y5CMVsMwMPXt9anQJxdtpPJTDeXUJfnduMn","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1631098800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1631703600}","startTimestamp":1631098800,"endTimestamp":1631703600,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 6, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Passionate hatcher and supporter here of both TEC and CS \ud83d\udc9a I'm submitting this proposal in the hopes to create a conversation and evaluation team around a potential high-impact go-to-market strategy.\nBefore I start, please forgive me if this contravenes TEC processes or just all around doesn't make sense - happy to can it - as I'm not fully in the loop.\n\n-- Proposal Information:\n\nHypothesis 1:\nTEC consists of the best token engineers in the web3 space. Other very wealthy DAOs are desperately craving counsel on their token and incentive structures... \ud83d\udca1 PraiseBots, hatch parameters, bonding curve issuance are incredible design parameters few DAOists know about.\n\nHypothesis 2:\nIt feels to me sometimes a bit like the TEC community is over-engineering its own design params. Dogfooding the dogfood. The Hatch took a long time and in my opinion was in some aspects convoluted bc. we wanted to experiment with multiple designs - best intentions of course.\n\n-- Idea:\nWhat if the TEC community began integrating its amazing ideas into the many DAOs that face big incentive problems and through that rapidly prototype the tool kit. \n1. This could create massive networks effects for TEC DAO via other DAOs\n2. Enable rapid prototyping of the core stack and toolset that TEC is trying to build. Good user feedback is the hardest thing to get. And desperate users are the best users.\n3. Also imagine how many token designers we might attract from those DAOs.\n4. Lastly, creating sustainable income\/token swaps + helping others in need\n\nDogfooding only works for so long \ud83d\udc36  and the opportunity here to help is incredible IMO. We can always revert to our own tooling and perfect that!\n\n-- Proposal Ask: create a small 3-week project team to evaluate if, what and how TEC tooling could be serviced to another DAO for income. Requires time commitments.\n\n-- Outcome: identify one DAO that will buy a solution (effectively the design-thinking to help implement a TEC module) for income & integrating a TEC module into the wild. Why paid? Because that increases the stakes and expectations and good work deserves to be paid.\n\nInsert meme: \"You guys are getting paid?\"\n\n-- Team\nI couldn't lead this but could certainly help source DAOs.","protocol":"token-engineering-commons","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x45602BFBA960277bF917C1b2007D1f03d7bd29e4","totalVotes":3,"blockNumber":18335053,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/tecommons.eth\/proposal\/QmRDY8mUk3geTaKByTT5qvSe7pJtcmUTsLNafNxYRzCnUZ","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1632996000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1633600800}","startTimestamp":1632996000,"endTimestamp":1633600800,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yay', 'Nay']","results":"[{'total': 180667.98, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 13928.694, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Please feel free to leave feedback on the [Forum thread.](https:\/\/forum.tecommons.org\/t\/one-time-change-of-tech-addresses-as-requested-by-owner-because-access-was-lost-or-another-reason\/571)\n\nIf the vote passes on Snapshot, we will make this proposal on the Hatch DAO.\n\n***Proposal Title:***\n\nOne time change of TECH addresses (as requested by owner because access was lost or another reason)\n\n***Proposal Information:***\n\nSeveral people have lost their keys or asked to switch their TECH address. As a human centered community we have a vested interest to ensure that our community members retain their voting rights by control of their wallets. We are a value aligned community, committed to nurture the TEC economy in its early stage, while focused on long term success. It is important that everyone in this group has a holding of their tokens and feels comfortable with their address to engage in upcoming decisions.\n\nNote: We recognize that there may be future requests for address changes. Future requests are not covered within the scope of this proposal.\n\n***Proposal Details:***\n\nAllow a period of time for requests for address changes\nBurn TECH in those addresses and remint to specified new addresses\nMake request to Commons Stack to burn CSTK in those addresses and remint to specified new addresses\nExpected duration or delivery date (if applicable):\n\n***Proposed timeline:***\n\n*Snapshot vote*: Sept 2 (for 4 days)\n*Accepting requests for address changes:* now until Sept 15 12pm CET\n*HatchDAO vote:* Sept 16\n*Burn and minting TECH (Commons Stack will determine timeline for CSTK):* Sept 21\n\nTo make this request, our community members should contact griff#3281, Dan Knobelsdorf.eth#0326  and Tam2140#9361 for security reasons and (1) share the reason for the change, (2) the old address, and (3) the new address.\n\nSep 12 griff#3281 will post on the forum thread all the addresses that are going to be burned and the addresses where all those tokens are going to be minted for transparency, if no one opposes the decision it\u2019s going live as stated before on sep 16.\n\nIf the community supports this initiative on the snapshot vote we will propose to the Hatch DAO to burn and mint the TECH, and request that Commons Stack does the same for CSTK.\n\nHow does this help Token Engineers and benefit the Token Engineering community?\n\nIt reinforce our cultural build as a human center DAO\n\n***Team Information (For Funding Proposals)***\n\nThese are the community members that will support and provide the initial funding for the tollgate fee for the Hatch DAO proposal.\n\nZeptimus\nTamara\nGriff\nDan\n\n***Funding Information (For Funding Proposals)***\n\n1000 wxDAI from the non-redeemable pool in order to cover the tollgate fee \n","protocol":"token-engineering-commons","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xaa79B87DC8B046A5E4f7D03F1562D7fe5BF98737","totalVotes":18,"blockNumber":17886545,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/tecommons.eth\/proposal\/QmRXDFfSQoUzahxjuVGKspXD8NbwoR38CvUSU135vkNZEr","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1630692000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1630951200}","startTimestamp":1630692000,"endTimestamp":1630951200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[\"Let's help our Hatchers\", 'No, it could be dangerous']","results":"[{'total': 214469.22, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 5676.156, 'choice': 26}, {'total': 15173.168, 'choice': 59}, {'total': 4822.083, 'choice': 99}, {'total': 10498.555, 'choice': 999}, {'total': 25850.566, 'choice': 4999}, {'total': 5982.147, 'choice': 5899}, {'total': 62863.625, 'choice': 9999}, {'total': 13928.694, 'choice': 11999}]","events":"[]"}

First, our professional market makers will provide token liquidity. Second, we route AMM pools and list pairs with sufficient liquidity (currently Uniswap, SushiSwap)\n- The current process for listing tokens via AMM pools is as follows \n1. Core team selects popular tokens to list \n2. We check the AMM liquidity to ensure it\u2019s sufficient\n3. Engineer team tests and finalises the list of trading pairs  \n4. The team submits a TIP to list the select tokens  \n5. After the community proposal is approved, the tokens can be officially listed on Tokenlon.\n- This is a long and inefficient process, which does not meet the demand of Tokenlon users to trade tokens once it\u2019s trending \n \n#### Goal\nChange the listing mechanism so that we can list trending tokens quickly on Tokenlon to meet the needs of users\n \n#### Proposed Action Item\n- Tokenlon's core team defines the standards for listing new pairs and decides whether or not to list , instead of submitting a proposal to vote for each listing\n- I.e. The Tokenlon core team will take charge of listing from beginning to end\n\nNotes\n- The new listing standards are considered by the core team based on factors such as slippage protection, TVL, whether it is secure, and whether there is a contract locking mechanism.\n- Community members can still propose tokens that meet the liquidity requirements to list on Tokenlon. Please submit your proposal through the [Tokenlon Governance Forum](https:\/\/forum.tokenlon.im\/) or [Tokenlon Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/ZFf4Cye) and we will assess the token. \n \n#### Voting Rules\n- Addresses with more than 0 LON or xLON can vote\n- Voting start time: 2022.1.26 8:00 UTC\n- Voting end time: 2022.1.28 8:00 UTC\n \n#### Voting Options\n- A.

This is after taking into account the current LON treasury and trading fees on average. Under this proposal, users will no longer receive rewards for providing LON liquidity.\n\n- Details of the proposal are in the table below\n\n| Pair Token    | Fund source |   Initial amount | \n| :---        |    :----      |      :-----   | \n|LON|Liquidity reserved|2,690,190|\n|USDT|Fee collected|per LON pair amount|\n\n- Benefits of this change\n-- By focusing LON liquidity in an AMM pool, we improve price discovery and trading depth of LON\n-- Under the current liquidity mining scheme, many users receive LON and sell it on the open market. By having the protocol take charge of liquidity, we can prevent the selling pressure of LON and stabilize the LON price.\n-- Under the new proposal, the treasury will consist of other tokens such as ETH and stablecoins. In the event of a bull market, the LON treasury will increase in value with these tokens. In bear markets, it will not have a huge decrease in value, giving the team a stronger hedge.

By having the protocol take charge of liquidity, we can prevent the selling pressure of LON and stabilize the LON price.\n-- Under the new proposal, the treasury will consist of other tokens such as ETH and stablecoins. In the event of a bull market, the LON treasury will increase in value with these tokens. In bear markets, it will not have a huge decrease in value, giving the team a stronger hedge.

The higher of the miner fee, the higher cost you incur to trigger the buyback.\n\n#### Goal Of Proposal\nWe would like the community to decide on whether to airdrop LON rewards to these 41 addresses for their work in triggering the LON buyback between 10th August 4:00 pm UTC and 14th November 4:00 pm UTC for the community. The rewards will come from the LON treasury.\n\n#### Proposed Action Items\nAccording to the voting result, we will decide whether to implement the reward. And if the proposal passes, the LON airdrop time will be determined.\n\n#### Voting Rules\n- Addresses with more than 0 LON can vote\n- Addresses with more than 0 xLON can vote\n- Addresses currently participating in LON liquidity mining or holding the respective LP tokens can vote (including unclaimed LON reward)\n- LON balance snapshot block: 13631477\n- Voting start time: 2021.11.17 7:00 UTC\n- Voting end time: 2021.11.17 7:00 UTC\n\n#### Voting Options\n- A.

The higher of the miner fee, the higher cost you incur to trigger the buyback.\n\n#### Goal Of Proposal\nWe would like the community to decide on whether to airdrop LON rewards to these **161** addresses for their work in triggering the LON buyback between **12th May 4:00 pm UTC** and **10th August 4:00 pm UTC** for the community. The rewards will come from the LON treasury.\n\n#### Proposed Action Items\nAccording to the voting result, we will decide whether to implement the reward. And if the proposal passes, the LON airdrop time will be determined.\n\n\n#### Voting Rules\n- Addresses with more than 0 LON can vote\n- Addresses with more than 0 xLON can vote\n- Addresses currently participating in LON liquidity mining or holding the respective LP tokens can vote (including unclaimed LON reward)\n- LON balance snapshot block: **13008892**\n- Voting start time: **2021.8.12 7:00 UTC**\n- Voting end time: **2021.8.15 7:00 UTC**\n\n#### Voting Options\n- A.

As of 15th June, the total has reached 573,192.93 LONs which exceeds the total reward on phase II. The current trade mining cycle of each phase is 4 weeks.\n- The market maker is one of the key participant on LON trade mining. They will share the reward pool of the \"liquidity provider\" in each period. And after the end of each phase, they can claim their reward together with normal traders on Tokenlon,  but the reward will not be distributed in one time.

If funded, this program will reimburse users who migrate funds by 11\/1\/21 0:00 UTC as specified by the proposal below.\n\n## Objective:\nReimburse ~90% of gas costs (capped at 50 Gwei) for users who complete each or all of the following migrations:\n- legacy tfTUSD pool \u2192 new tfTUSD pool & liquidity gauge\n- existing tfUSDC farm \u2192 liquidity gauge\n- existing tfUSDT farm \u2192 liquidity gauge\n\n## Budget:\n- Total budget: up to 40,000 TRU (~$20k USD as of posting)\n- TRU tokens to be allocated from the TRU supply\u2019s unallocated incentives\n- Reimbursements are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis for users who migrate by 11\/1\/21 0:00 UTC\n\n## Program Details:\n- Users who migrate existing tokens to new liquidity gauge and\/or the new tfTUSD pool + liquidity gauge receive TRU as reimbursement for gas costs\n- Amount of TRU received based upon flat gas reimbursements per migration, gas prices at time of migration, and TRU and ETH prices at time of migration.

Although the proposal already exceeded the 40m quorum threshold during the consensus check, the Uniswap community feels it is important to allow all UNI holders the opportunity to cast a vote. One important argument in favor of this decision is that Snapshot is not supported by custody providers like Coinbase, Anchorage, etc., smart contract wallets like Argent\/Gnosis safe, or meta governance layers like Index & Compound. \n\nGovernor Bravo requires at least one on-chain action, so the proposal includes a transfer of 0 UNI to satisfy the requirement.\n\nIf the proposal passes this phase, the Uniswap Labs can deploy Uniswap on Polygon on behalf of the Uniswap community.","protocol":"uniswap","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9B68c14e936104e9a7a24c712BEecdc220002984","totalVotes":75,"blockNumber":13786993,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13786993}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13827313}","startTimestamp":1639267250,"endTimestamp":1639806687,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR', 'ABSTAIN']","results":"[{'total': 503009.4, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 72126216, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13861316}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1640261264}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13827677}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1639811581}]"}
{"refId":"cHJvcG9zYWw6dW5pc3dhcDpkZWZhdWx0Ojk=","id":"9","title":"Add 1 Basis Point Fee Tier ","content":"TLDR: Uniswap should add a 1bps fee tier with 1 tick spacing. This change is straightforward from a technical perspective and would help Uniswap compete in stablecoin <> stablecoin pairs, where the majority of the market share is taken by Curve and DODO.  ## Background on pool fees Uniswap v3 allows for the creation of new pools via calls to the [factory contract](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x1F98431c8aD98523631AE4a59f267346ea31F984). In order to keep liquidity for pairs consolidated, only a few fee options are allowed\u2013currently, 5, 30, and 100 basis points are supported (10, 60, 200 tick spacing).  Governance should add a 1 basis point fee option for the following reasons: * Curve\u2019s stablecoin markets have 3-4 bps fees. * Dodo\u2019s stablecoin markets have a 1 bps fee. * FTX\u2019s fees for retail are 2\/7bps fees and for whales 0\/4bps.  However, we recognize there are some potential counterarguments to adding this fee tier: * Adding too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity. * Liquidity providers may earn less in fees.  ### We discuss each of these points in greater detail below This will allow for the creation of much more competitive stablecoin<>stablecoin pools.  Offering low slippage on stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs in AMMs is generally easier than other pairs due to their relatively low price volatility.  As such, the determining factor in driving volume is trading fees. Pouring more capital into a 5 bps fee pool won\u2019t necessarily make Uniswap v3\u2019s pricing more attractive, as lower cost pools exist such as [Curve\u2019s 3pool](https:\/\/curve.fi\/3pool) (3 bps fees) and [DODO\u2019s USDC-USDT](https:\/\/app.dodoex.io\/liquidity?network=mainnet) pool (1 bps fees). Indeed, [most USDC-USDT volume from 1inch is routed to DODO](https:\/\/dune.xyz\/queries\/135498). Very little of it is routed to Uniswap v3.  [In the DEX market as a whole](https:\/\/dune.xyz\/queries\/150801) (not just 1inch), DODO and Curve still take the majority of the market share (60-70%) in USDC-USDT trading. Uniswap v3\u2019s concentrated liquidity helped increase market share, but lower fees can help it grab more.  The data tells a similar story for DAI-USDC (see [1inch exported volume](https:\/\/dune.xyz\/queries\/152001) and [overall market share](https:\/\/dune.xyz\/queries\/151999)), though in the case of DAI-USDC, DODO is less active. While the case is compelling just from competition in the DEX space, Uniswap also competes with centralized exchanges.  Many centralized exchanges offer lower than 5 basis point taker fees for high volume traders ([Binance](https:\/\/www.binance.com\/en\/fee\/schedule) offers < 5 basis point fees above 40K BTC in 30-day volume, [FTX](https:\/\/help.ftx.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360024479432-Fees) above $25M in 30-day volume, etc.). Lower fees could increase the DEX volume pie by comparing favorably to spot markets on centralized exchanges and drawing volume from large players. ### The change is a very light touch. The change requires just one function call\u2013[`enableFeeAmount(100)`](https:\/\/github.com\/Uniswap\/v3-core\/blob\/b2c5555d696428c40c4b236069b3528b2317f3c1\/contracts\/interfaces\/IUniswapV3Factory.sol#L77)\u2013on the factory contract. Governance controls this contract, so a simple proposal could make this change.  The enableFeeAmount function takes as parameters  1. Fee: the fee amount denominated in 100ths of a basis point. 2. `tickSpacing`: the granularity one may specify a liquidity range (see the Uniswap v3 Core [whitepaper](https:\/\/uniswap.org\/whitepaper-v3.pdf) for more details)  To add a 1 basis point fee option, fee would be 100.  `tickSpacing` requires some consideration. On the one hand, too high of a value restricts LPs\u2019 ability to set granular prices, since initializable price ticks would be roughly [`tickSpacing`] basis points apart. On the other hand, too low of a value could entail liquidity being too low in each tick, meaning that larger orders may need to cross multiple ticks to fill, entailing extra gas cost for each additional tick.  We suggest that a value of 1 for `tickSpacing` would be reasonable for 1 basis point fee pools, allowing LPs to set prices with precision in positions that span ~1 basis point between initializable ticks.  For a stablecoin market like USDC-USDT, we expect most of the liquidity to reside in 6 ticks. Orders <$1m will like only require 1 tick and larger orders may require a second or third tick. For each tick used it adds about 15k-20k gas costs.  ### Too many fee tiers can fragment liquidity  The downside of adding too many fee tier possibilities is that liquidity is then fragmented across pools. However, we believe that LPs will naturally settle over time into the fee tier that is most appropriate for the volatility of the pair.  Pairs with particularly low volatility, like stablecoin<>stablecoin pairs, will likely have a liquidity migration to the 1 bps tier, as the required return to capital should be low in equilibrium given the low risk of impermanent loss.  ### LPs may earn less in fees  Assuming overall volume stays stable (although it\u2019s worth mentioning more competitive fees should grow the pie), total fees paid will go down (volume would have to 5X for fees paid to LPs to stay the same).  However, LPs are not the only constituency to take into consideration\u2013takers will be paying lower fees in aggregate. Growing Uniswap\u2019s market share and being the best place to trade across many pairs is important. These pools could become more enticing to large traders looking to swap stablecoins, for instance.  ## Concluding Thoughts  We believe this simple change could boost Uniswap\u2019s competitiveness in low volatility pairs, and the change presents minimal risk for Uniswap.","protocol":"uniswap","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9B68c14e936104e9a7a24c712BEecdc220002984","totalVotes":41,"blockNumber":13551293,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 13551293}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 13591613}","startTimestamp":1636043483,"endTimestamp":1636588989,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR', 'ABSTAIN']","results":"[{'total': 71369770, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 13591709}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1636590395}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 13604706}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1636766141}]"}

[On-Chain Proposal]() ## Summary and Motivation: *Co-written with [Getty Hill](https:\/\/twitter.com\/getty_hill) (@Getty), [Eddy Lee ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/yesimeddy) (@elee), [Yuan Han Li ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/yuan_han_li) (@yuan-han-li), [John Wang ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/j0hnwang) (@johnwang), and [Ali Khambati ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/alikhambati1) (@alikhambati)* Governor Alpha, the current governance contract used, was a great start, but in light of Compound's and other protocols upgrade to Governor Bravo, Uniswap should migrate given Bravo's additional safety benefits and upgradability. 1. **Native upgradeability:** Under Governor Alpha, changes to governance parameters require deploying a new contract and completely migrating to a new address. This is particularly damaging to governance participation as it introduces downtime and asynchronicity. Many governance tools and custodians use factory contracts which point to a specific contract address, meaning parties must manually upgrade their infrastructure every time governance parameters are changed under Governor Alpha. This includes tools for creating autonomous proposals like [fish.vote ](https:\/\/www.fish.vote\/); front-ends such as [Tally ](https:\/\/www.withtally.com\/), [Sybil](https:\/\/sybil.org\/#\/delegates\/uniswap), and [Boardroom ](https:\/\/app.boardroom.info\/) which aggregate and display governance results for various protocols; and professional custodians which are used by large token holders, delegates, and community members. Enabling a static contract address that has proxy upgradability patterns is paramount for maximizing participation, and maintaining an open and secure governance process. 2. **Voting reason string:** Governor Bravo gives voters the opportunity to add free-form comments (text strings) along with their on-chain votes. Not only does this increase the transparency around the rationale people have behind their votes, but it also facilitates more in-depth and nuanced discussion. 3. **New \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdabstain' voting option:** Governor Bravo enables voters to formally abstain rather than forcing them to choose between voting yes\/no or not voting at all. This will give voters more flexibility and also increase transparency into delegate behavior. 4. **Proposal numbers won't reset:** Under Governor Alpha, any upgrades to the contract resets the proposal number schema. Notice that [\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdProposal 0.4'](https:\/\/app.uniswap.org\/#\/vote\/0\/4) (which resulted in deployment and migration to a new Governor Alpha contract due to modifying the proposal submission threshold parameter) caused the following on-chain proposal from @HarvardLawBFI to be numbered [\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdProposal 1.1' ](https:\/\/app.uniswap.org\/#\/vote\/1\/1). Under Governor Bravo, this would not be an issue and proposal numbers would be continuous because the contract would be maintained at a single address. 5. **Proposal Cancellation:** Bravo allows user-directed cancellations enabling erroneous proposals to be canceled if need be (rather than forcing people to vote no\/abstain). 6. **Review Period:** Governor Bravo allows governance to include a review\/analysis period. Currently, Compound uses a 13140 block (~2-day) review period that allows holders to review the proposal. This means that users will have 2-days to prepare for voting (e.g., remove UNI from Aave), unlike Governor Alpha which instantly snapshots users' voting power. A review period substantially improves the accessibility and safety of the governance process. ## Implementation: After speaking with the OpenZeppelin team about their reimplementation of Governor Bravo, we think using Compound's Governor Bravo contract instead makes the most sense at this stage. Although Open Zeppelin's Governor contract takes a simpler approach that can include all Bravo functionality, it does not do so by default. The contract uses similar logic, but the code is new. It has gone through an internal audit and review process but still needs to go through an external audit. For the safety and simplicity of Uniswap, we think using Compound's Governor Bravo contract is the best decision for the time being. Compound's Governor contract has already undergone an [audit](https:\/\/blog.openzeppelin.com\/compound-governor-bravo-audit\/) by OpenZeppelin and has been widely used. We can always change\/upgrade to Open Zeppelin Governor contract at a future date if their contract introduces new features\/functionality the community is interested in. More details on OpenZeppelin's code can be found here: [Github](https:\/\/github.com\/OpenZeppelin\/openzeppelin-contracts\/tree\/master\/contracts\/governance) [Docs](https:\/\/docs.openzeppelin.com\/contracts\/4.x\/api\/governance) [More info](https:\/\/openzeppelin.notion.site\/Comparing-Compound-Governor-to-OpenZeppelin-Governor-2-10d0fdcf61ba476fae492b295822ee13) As mentioned in the previous Consensus Check, we have deployed the contract on the Ropsten test net for the community to review our code: [Governor Bravo Delegator](https:\/\/ropsten.etherscan.io\/address\/0x15df15caad12adaa03949014ba5cc49a84803d0f#code) [Governor Bravo Delegate](https:\/\/ropsten.etherscan.io\/address\/0xD8bf60dfC5115F6cB99bb50502346E7b863800f1#code) [Github for contracts](https:\/\/github.com\/gettty\/uniswap-gov) *NB: The `_initiate` function has been slightly modified to take an initial proposal number as an input rather than pulling it from Governor Alpha. This way Uniswap can resume proper proposal numbering.* ## Resource links: 1.

Establishes a \u201cNo Negative Net UNI\u201d ethos, whereby the initial grant amount is maintained\n2.  Uses Uniswap\u2019s own yield mechanisms to sustainably self-fund the program\n\nThese two items enable a much more substantive value-alignment mechanism.  It ensures assets remain close to the ecosystem itself, and can be monitored directly.  It also sets up the long-term capacity for the program to fund itself.\n\nIn addition, we have structured the proposal to include an Oversight Committee, whose sole responsibility is to ensure the program delivers value.  In the event it is deemed ineffective, the Oversight Committee may return the initial grant to the governance process for reassignment to other opportunities.\n\n## **Grant Request - $15M Year 1, $10M Year 2**\n\nWith community member feedback, we have updated our $25M recommendation to a $15M grant in year 1, with a $10M additional grant triggered at the first anniversary with program success.  With $15M of UNI the model can be proven at near-break even; if successful, the remaining $10M will allow for a longer-term commitment.  Note that all commitments must be reviewed for efficacy at the 3 year mark by the Oversight Committee [the Committee can call for a review at any time].\n\nAssuming a 30% yield target is achieved, the $15M will generate approximately $2,250,000 in yield each year, or $187,500 per month. The application of the $187,500 will look as follows:\n\n**50% of this will be delivered to ecosystem community members as bounties ($93,750 per month)**\n\nFlipside\u2019s value proposition begins with analytics, **but its true purpose is to drive ecosystem acquisition and retention:**\n\n*Ecosystem acquisition:*\n\nUtilizing a series of educational programs (see [Terra scavenger hunt](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/teamflipside\/Terra-Explorer-Hunt-7d77cf0c41be475daf1cdec34354fbc4), [SQL training solutions](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8jYqYcB7e1s)), and a hands-on community and analytics team, we activate new members into the ecosystem.  This teaches new users how to actually use a complex protocol, how to think about the underlying mechanics, and even how to start becoming adept at using SQL to build queries and public-facing outcomes.\n\nFor our pilot Uniswap program, 69% of bounty recipients had never held UNI before (37 \/ 54).\n\n**Using this baseline data, this larger scale program will continue to deliver new participants to the Uniswap ecosystem at a projected rate of more than 900 per year [out of 1300 total].**\n\n*Ecosystem retention:*\n\nThe guiding metric for bounty flows is the percent of distributed tokens that are not sold or swapped after they are received. This reflects a traditional retention metric: the community member has chosen to remain involved in and supportive of the ecosystem.\n\nAcross our pilot program for Uniswap, 77% of the bountied UNI remained within the ecosystem (2,026 \/ 2,631).\n\n**Using this baseline data, this larger scale program will retain $900K UNI [50K Tokens] out of $1.125M UNI [64K Tokens] bountied per year.**\n\nOf the $93,750 in bounties per month, $25-$50k would be utilized to drive acquisition and $40k-$75k to motivate sophisticated analysts to drive substantive outcomes.  This latter portion is critical as historically speaking, \u201cpower users\u2019' of analytics have kept the most impactful insights to themselves.  Enabling sophisticated solutions to enter the public domain - like the [Uniswap V3 Fee Calculator](http:\/\/uniswapv3.flipsidecrypto.com) - enables ecosystem health and growth.\n\nAll bounties are delivered through weekly programs:  Flipside sources questions from the Community and Uniswap Labs, prepares a bounty construct, releases to the community, QAs all results, and distributes bounties to the most effective outcomes.  This is a complex and very time consuming process, but the return is significant:  extremely directed results that serve community needs with immediacy.  Bounties range from $40 to $650 each, determined by the complexity of the request.\n\n*Bounties for Flipside + Dune Analytics, TheGraph and others*\n\nAnother significant clarification from our initial proposal is that bounties may be constructed for engagement of analysts across other analytics platforms such as Dune Analytics, The Graph and others.  We believe strongly in the overall analytics ecosystem.  We are excited to contribute to effective analysis wherever it may occur.  We will deliver a variety of programs that emphasize the ultimate development of results wherever users are interested in congregating.\n\nAs it relates to the Uniswap Grant Program, these bounties would be focused solely on analytics solutions, while the UGP would provide grants for a broader array of opportunities.\n\n*Year 1 Program Expectations:*\n\nGiven the pilot program data, the expected results from a year of bounties would be as follows:\n-   ~ 900 new community members [acquisition]*\n-   ~ 49,500 UNI retained in ecosystem [retention]\n-   ~ 350+ dashboards and visualizations [+premium interactive solutions]\n\n*recognizing that the entire program is funded by yield, there is a $0 CAC on the acquisition. If you use the yield rate, the CAC is ~$1,250 per analyst.\n\n**The other 50% ($93,750 per month) is Flipside\u2019s Fee To Operate the Program:**\n\nAgain, this fee is paid by the yield, not by the grant itself.  This aligns with Flipside\u2019s belief that the grant is meant to support the community, and the assets are the community\u2019s tokens.   In that way, Flipside\u2019s role is to hold these assets on behalf of the DAO and to distribute the yield to the community, per the terms of the Program.\n\nProgram costs are approximately $100k-$115k per month, excluding taxes.  This includes:\n\nSalaries:\n-   One Data Engineer (100%)\n-   One Data Scientists (100%)\n-   One Full Stack Engineer (100%)\n-   One Business Intelligence Analyst (100%)\n-   One Community Manager (100%)\n-   One Marketing Manager (100%)\n-   One Content Manager (100%)\n-   One Designer (50%)\n-   One Product Manager (10%)\n-   Head of Engineering (10%)\n-   Head of Marketing (10%)\n-   Head of Data Science (10%)\n-   Head of Finance (10%)\n-   Financial Controller (10%)\n\n*Tech Infrastructure*\n\nAdditionally, our cost estimates conservatively include a 10% allocation of our projected infrastructure costs, inclusive of node management (ETH), compute \/ storage needs (AWS), data warehousing (Snowflake) needs and a variety of other software \/ architecture tooling requirements to sustain and make the Flipside Velocity database freely available to analysts of all levels.\n\n*Taxes on Yield*\n\nNote that Flipside will also be covering 30% tax rate on all yield, which also impacts the final margin.\n\n*It Does Not Include*\n\nAny fee for the IP developed to provide historical state-ready analytics.\n\nAlso note that no general G&A costs are included in this (ie: human resources, operations, employee benefits).\n\n*Margin*\n\nAt the $15M grant level, Flipside is operating at a near BE margin.  We are willing to operate at this level to prove the model in year 1 (note that we expect to compound our fees to generate additional yield, which should help us to mitigate margin pressure).\n\nIn year 2, with a $10M additional grant, Flipside\u2019s margin would be able to increase to 18%.\n\n## Automated Investment Strategy\n\nWe outlined an approach in our [temperature check](https:\/\/gov.uniswap.org\/t\/temperature-check-larger-grant-program-construct-community-enabled-analytics-no-negative-net-uni\/13044) that will generate perpetual yield for a continuous CEA program while mitigating negative effects on the UNI token. Based on feedback from key community participants, we have made slight revisions to our strategy, and recommend the following:\n\n-   100% of the UNI be deposited into AAVE protocol as collateral\n-   Borrow against 50% of the collateral in the form of ETH\n-   A DeFi Saver Smart Wallet will be used to manage the position\n-   50% of the borrowed ETH to be swapped into UNI, and both assets will be deposited as liquidity in the WETH-UNI 0.3% pool symmetrically\n-   A custom Visor vault developed with Gamma Strategies will be used to manage the liquidity position\n\nTo optimize yield and minimize risk, we will partner with [Gamma Strategies](https:\/\/github.com\/gammastrategies) and [Visor Finance](http:\/\/visor.finance\/) to automatically manage our position in the Uniswap V3 pool. Automated position management ensures we can optimally realize & compound rewards to maximize yield for the program, while minimizing risks of human error.\n\nEach time that the LP position is rebalanced, 50% of the accrued fees will be distributed to a wallet designated for bounties, while the other 50% (due to Flipside) will be compounded back into the LP for the first year.  This will result in additional yield generation for the program over the course of time through the power of compounding.\n\nConcurrently, we will be utilizing [DefiSaver](https:\/\/defisaver.com\/) to automatically manage our leveraged position on AAVE.   In the event of meaningful divergence between UNI and ETH prices, DefiSaver will minimize any risks of liquidation by optimizing for collateralization via programmatic debt paydown using AAVE\u2019s flash loans.  Any fees incurred for utilizing flash loans will be more than offset with the yield generated from the LP.\n\nWhile the overall yield generated through the use of collateralization is less than investing the entire grant position outright directly into the LP, we believe there are numerous benefits to this approach:\n\n-   No requirement to sell UNI, since we will be borrowing ETH against the UNI collateral.  In light of recent events, we believe this is a desirable outcome for the community\n-   Deepens the liquidity of UNI on AAVE, a major DeFi protocol\n\nFinally, the risk of obtaining the most effective yield - and the bounties for participants and fees for Flipside - are entirely the responsibility of Flipside.  In the event the yield contribution is below expectations, the fees and bounties will reduce symmetrically.  In the event there is consistent reduction, the Allocation Committee (as noted below) will be able to evaluate other investment strategies for consideration, and approve changes.\n\n## Fiduciary Responsibility and Accountability to the DAO\n\nIt\u2019s critical that assets are managed effectively and are delivering value to the ecosystem. In the event the assets are not delivering value, they should be repurposed for other initiatives to enable ecosystem stability and growth. [Full details on oversight in the Consensus Check.](https:\/\/gov.uniswap.org\/t\/consensus-check-uniswap-funds-community-enabled-analytics-via-yield-generating-investment-strategies\/13220\/1)\n\nThree components provide effective checks and balances to ensure maximum accountability to the Uniswap ecosystem:\n\n**Allocation Committee:** whose purpose is to oversee fund execution strategy utilizing Gnosis Safe\u2019s industry standard multi-sig technology to ensure both effective management and protection\/safety of funds (longer-term, we would aim to migrate to Tally\u2019s Failsafe solution once enabled, which is built on top of Gnosis).\n\nThe 7-member Allocation Committee will be comprised of:\n-   [Will Price](https:\/\/twitter.com\/will__price?lang=en) \/ DeFi Citizen; Data Scientist\n-   [Nathan Howard](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nathan-howard-a5565756\/), Index Coop\n-   2 Individuals from University Blockchain Orgs.  To be Identified and Announced Post On-Chain Vote so as to not influence voting.\n-   3 Members of Flipside\u2019s Team\n\n**Oversight Committee:** whose purpose is to ensure that the grant proceeds are applied in a manner consistent with its design.\n\nThe Committee will meet and take a vote annually to evaluate the continuation of the program.\n\nOn the first anniversary of the program, the Committee may take a vote to remove the trigger of the second $10M grant.  The $10M grant will reside in the Gnosis Safe address where funds are delivered following governance execution, and will require requisite approval to facilitate a transfer of the assets into the contemplated strategies. Funds will be redirected towards other uses through the standard governance process should the program prove unsuccessful.\n\nIn the event the Oversight Committee determines the program to be ineffective, at any voting junction, the $25M grant would be submitted as a proposal to Uniswap Governance to be evaluated and re-assigned to other programs.\n\nThe 3-member Oversight Committee will be comprised of:\n-   [Nic Carter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/nic__carter), Supreme Being\n-   [Boris Stanic,](https:\/\/gov.uniswap.org\/t\/boris-stanic-bor4-community-first\/12667) Uniswap\/TheStable\n-   [Dave Balter,](https:\/\/twitter.com\/davebalter?lang=en) CEO Flipside\n\n**Transparency Dashboard:** Tracking fund performance and transaction activities will be broadcast live via a custom dashboard for the Uniswap community.\n\n## Summary:  Community-Enabled Analytics for Uniswap\n\nThe purpose of the grant is to utilize yield to acquire and retain new community members, by funding a sophisticated education and analytics platform.

This proposal has passed the temperature and consensus checks with **[massive supermajorities](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/uniswap\/proposal\/QmaUPBYqkiKnwkaVNVrUDpD6fk5EXXTqJjn71qHNYW4YQn)** after a month of healthy, spirited debate. Since the Temperature Check posted, the need for this fund has become even more apparent. We have incorporated much of the constructive feedback to balance transparency, effectiveness, and speed to further this entity\u2019s important mission for the community.\n\nThe 501(c)(4) will fund education and advocacy through both existing advocacy organizations and potentially new ones. The funding will have the goals of 1) pushing back against misguided regulatory, legal, or political threats to decentralized finance; 2) achieving regulatory clarity for decentralized finance and related activity; 3) advancing laws that support decentralized finance and decentralized governance; and 4) spurring other DeFi protocols\u2019 governance bodies to contribute to the effort (through this entity or their own). The entity will be nonpartisan and global in approach and orientation.\n\n#### The DeFi Education Fund will fund all of the following:\n\n* Policy-maker education: we need more people directly educating legislative and regulatory policymakers about DeFi and advocating for policy positions that favor DeFi and its participants;\n* Thought leadership and research: we need more written and video content explaining DeFi and its benefits in a medium that positively impacts the public perception of DeFi;\n* Legal firepower: we need to develop a strong bench of legal advocates in multiple jurisdictions and venues;\n* Messaging: we need to better formulate ideas, prepare spokespeople, and communicate to policymakers and the general public on the benefits and promise of DeFi;\n* Grassroots advocacy: we need to make it easy for individuals who already care about DeFi to voice their opinions to policymakers globally alongside organized efforts; and\n* Best practices: we need more analysis and legal models for all DeFi projects to benefit from collectively.\n\nThis entity will not replicate the great work of existing organizations such as Coin Center, Fight for the Future, the Blockchain Association, the Crypto Council for Innovation, the Defi Alliance, Blockchain for Europe, or others. Rather, among other things, it will help to fund these and other organizations to expand their capabilities to more effectively advocate for and advance DeFi protocols.\n\nFurther, this entity will extend its monetary impact by conditioning some of its grants with matching by other governance treasuries, crypto foundations, or crowd-matching.\n\nGrants administration for advocacy is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated, and thus we propose a grants committee overseen by an accountable entity. This committee will hire a grants-making leader or staff and create an efficient, predictable process for applicants.\n\nWe propose the following as the initial committee members, with a subset of them serving as the entity\u2019s board of directors. All have expressed their willingness to join the committee:\n\n1. Larry Sukernik, co-founder, Reverie.\n2. Rebecca Rettig, General Counsel, Aave Companies.\n3. Jake Chervinsky, General Counsel, Compound Labs & Strategic Advisor, Variant Fund.\n4. Marc Boiron, General Counsel, dYdX Trading.\n5. Katie Biber, Chief Legal Officer of Brex, Board of Directors of Anchorage.\n6. Sheila Warren, World Economic Forum, Executive Committee (Cryptocurrency Lead).\n7. Marvin Ammori, Chief Legal Officer, Uniswap Labs.\n\nDue to the dynamic and somewhat unpredictable state of global policy proposals, we believe the grant-making committee should have considerable discretion to allow for flexibility and speed, subject to the necessary disclosure of its activities on a regular basis. We expect many members to serve pro bono and total compensation across the committee to be less than $150,000 annually.\n\nThe following changes have been incorporated due to community feedback:\n\n* The name will focus on education rather than defense\u2013the DeFi Education Fund.\n* The scope is broadened to include the funding of organizations working to promote best regulatory practices among those in the DeFi ecosystem.\n* Beyond the considerable disclosure required for a 501(c)(4), the entity will publicly post monthly community updates on progress, grant allocation, tactics, etc. These updates will not only ensure trust but will also keep the community informed on when and how they can lend their voice to the policy process. When there are surprises, as there so often have been in the policy space, the Committee will report why and how funds will be reallocated to address them.\n* The 501(c)(4) will promptly hire at least one full-time staffer to manage the day-to-day operations of the organization with oversight from the board of directors and who will serve as the primary point of contact for the governance community.\n* The 501(c)(4) will issue a detailed budget within 90 days of the proposal passing. Note that budgets, projections, and 5-year plans often must be revised and amended.\n\n##### Multisig wallet address: 0x1C95930Dfc1139381265ce45B5f480F1EFae09A1\n---\n### A Word About Trust and the Multisig Wallet:\n\nWhile we are thrilled the Consensus Check passed with [strong approval](https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/uniswap\/proposal\/QmaUPBYqkiKnwkaVNVrUDpD6fk5EXXTqJjn71qHNYW4YQn) (73% for, 27% against), it\u2019s important to us that we operate this initiative in a way that even those who voted against can get behind.\n\nIn particular, there was feedback that the proposal asked for a lot of money upfront with little in the way of checks and balances. We believe that the structure does provide a lot in the way of checks and balances. Nonetheless, we detail some of the steps we took to add even more checks in the design of the proposal.\n\nTo safely and transparently hold the funds, a 4\/7 multisig consisting of the seven committee members was created at the following address: 0x1C95930Dfc1139381265ce45B5f480F1EFae09A1. To be even more precise, here are the names and addresses of the seven multisig members:\n\n* Jake Chervinsky | 0xdC856762b024814F6B5dc28e97e514e001D6820C | o\/b\/o Defi Education Fund\n* Larry Sukernik | 0x773EE93E36bAaFa7F73B41ccC6800126829d3589 | o\/b\/o Defi Education Fund\n* Rebecca Rettig | 0xcF8C946C6819dafE62f82803E01eB27Ea232825C | o\/b\/o Defi Education Fund\n* Marc Boiron | 0x2132bEADc4D7b196249c1A746B8eeA91099bb1cE | o\/b\/o Defi Education Fund\n* Marvin Ammori | 0xea067C58367D022a1c58354fE544C542c68587ec | o\/b\/o Defi Education Fund\n* Katie Biber | 0xcB598f253818398f3d91595f22D897096e240Ae3 | o\/b\/o Defi Education Fund\n* Sheila Warren | 0xbcAD071A51896666c3B48fC5Fd5A872981FB254E | o\/b\/o Defi Education Fund\n\nWhile a multisig wallet goes a long way towards trustlessly holding funds, we think Tally\u2019s new open-source product, [Failsafe](https:\/\/gov.uniswap.org\/t\/consensus-check-uni-should-fund-a-political-defense-organization-for-decentralized-finance\/12700\/67), would be helpful (fun fact: Failsafe was funded by the Uniswap Grants Program).\n\nSimply put, Failsafe is an additional safety mechanism built on top of the multisig wallet that allows Uniswap tokenholders to (i) stop any multisig transaction from taking place, and (ii) request funds sitting in the multisig to be sent back to Uniswap\u2019s treasury. We think this is a powerful product that all multisigs should use in the future.\n\nAlthough we want to use Failsafe as soon as possible, the product is just entering its trial phase with the Uniswap Grants Committee and is in the process of receiving code audits. While that means we can\u2019t use Failsafe from the get-go, the good news is Failsafe can be deployed on top of the multisig wallet after the fact. Once audited, we\u2019d like to integrate it to allow UNI tokenholders to have the ultimate say over the funds.\n\nThe Committee plans to put roughly half of the total grant into the Failsafe, and begin disbursing half immediately. It will seek the Failsafe funds on a quarterly or annual basis when those funds need to be accessed. However, because the Failsafe is not ready yet, you should cast your votes as though you are approving all 1M upfront.\n","protocol":"uniswap","adapter":"archiveAlpha","proposer":"0x61c8D4e4BE6477Bb49791540Ff297Ef30Eaa01c2","totalVotes":296,"blockNumber":12686657,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 12686657}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 12726977}","startTimestamp":1624399660,"endTimestamp":1624942681,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 15040581, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 79680960, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 12739956}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1625118065}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 12761477}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1625408001}]"}
{"refId":"cHJvcG9zYWw6dW5pc3dhcDphcmNoaXZlOjQ=","id":"4","title":"Reduce the UNI proposal submission threshold to 2.5M","content":"This proposal lowers the UNI proposal submission threshold from 10M UNI to 2.5M UNI.\n\nUniswap\u2019s governance system currently has a high threshold of 10M votes for proposal submission.  As mentioned in Dharma's [earlier proposal](https:\/\/app.uniswap.org\/#\/vote\/1), there have been  [discussions](https:\/\/gov.uniswap.org\/t\/proposal-reduce-amount-of-unis-required-to-submit-governance-proposal\/3320)  on  [lowering thresholds](https:\/\/gov.uniswap.org\/t\/proposal-reduce-amount-of-unis-required-to-submit-governance-proposal\/3320\/29)  to make governance more accessible.\n\nSince that original proposal, the number of delegated votes has increased from ~80M to ~170M, making it much easier to reach the quorum threshold of 40M votes. However, the UNI token price increase over the past 6 months has made the proposal submission threshold extremely difficult to achieve for one individual.\n\nThe Fish.vote team has prepared a new proposal in line with Dharma's original motivations: making governance more accessible, while still ensuring that Uniswap governance is not subject to unilateral deleterious actors.  _We propose a threshold of 2.5m UNI for proposal submission, and keeping the existing 40M quorum threshold._ Though this proposal threshold is still quite high, we believe in making small, conservative changes in the right direction.\n\nIn order to reduce these thresholds, a new  `GovernorAlpha` contract is required. We have chosen to use the same smart contract code from Dharma's original proposal with these new values. To that end, we have [deployed a new contract](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0xc4e172459f1e7939d522503b81afaac1014ce6f6#code) which contains the following changes:\n\n-   `proposalThreshold`  has been modified from  `10_000_000e18`  to  `2_500_000e18`, i.e. from 1% to 0.25%.\n-   a public  `__acceptAdmin()`  function has been added, allowing the contract to claim ownership over the  `Timelock`  contract once  `setPendingAdmin`  has been executed.\n-   `timelock`  and  `uni`  are now declared as  `constant`  instead of via assignment to storage slots during contract construction, as their values are not modifiable after deployment (and use of  `immutable`  would necessitate a major Solidity version bump and corresponding refactor of already well-audited code).\n\nWe believe this proposal is a conservative step in the right direction for UNI governance, and one that creates a more accessible governance ecosystem. We hope this is the first of many improvements that Fish.vote can be a part of.","protocol":"uniswap","adapter":"archive","proposer":"0xA13a5a31b891F3DA7074b740B694769BD0f1bb23","totalVotes":148,"blockNumber":12563485,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 12563485}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 12603805}","startTimestamp":1622749576,"endTimestamp":1623288259,"currentState":"executed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 2035.7363, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 90980776, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[{'time': {'blockNumber': 12603982}, 'event': 'queued', 'timestamp': 1623290703}, {'time': {'blockNumber': 12616961}, 'event': 'executed', 'timestamp': 1623463819}]"}

These 12,619 users are \"Phase 1\" of the Retroactive Distribution, encompassing users of application-integrations. All of these 12,619 addresses were excluded from the original airdrop.\n\nThe Phase determination was made based on how easy it is to programmatically hook a trading bot into them, as this is a proxy for what portion of these cohorts risk representing multiple addresses per end-user. Phase 1 is the less programmatically accessible cohort, indicating a lower likelihood of multiple addresses per end-user.\n\nSpecifically, this proposal transfers 5,047,600 UNI to a new MerkleDistributor contract, which will then allow for 400 UNI to be claimed by each of the 12,619 accounts held by users of the following projects:\n\n| Project    | Accounts | % of total |\n|------------|----------|------------|\n| Argent     | 3418     | 27.09%     |\n| DeFi Saver | 890      | 7.05%      |\n| Dharma     | 2833     | 22.45%     |\n| eidoo      | 301      | 2.39%      |\n| FURUCOMBO  | 57       | 0.45%      |\n| MEW        | 4278     | 33.90%     |\n| Monolith   | 19       | 0.15%      |\n| Nuo        | 740      | 5.86%      |\n| Opyn       | 79       | 0.63%      |\n| rebalance  | 4        | 0.03%      |\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### 1. No Repeat Retroactive Airdrop Proposals\n\nDharma is committed to carrying out the Retroactive Airdrop proposal. This includes proposing Phase 1, and, if Phase 1 passes, proposing Phase 2.\n\nIf either Phase fails, we will accept that as the final determination of the Uniswap community. Should both Phases pass, we will not vote in favor of any further retroactive airdops.\n\n### 2. Dharma's Commitment to Uniswap Governance\n\nDharma is committed to being an active, engaged member of Uniswap governance, just as we have been in the Compound community.\n\nAs a signal of this commitment, if this proposal passes, we will commit to:\n- Giving Dharma users the ability to delegate their UNI holdings for voting, as well as to vote directly with their UNI holdings.\n- Participating in the development of a Uniswap Improvement Proposal (UIP) Process in collaboration with other engaged community members.","protocol":"uniswap","adapter":"archive","proposer":"0x7e4A8391C728fEd9069B2962699AB416628B19Fa","totalVotes":340,"blockNumber":11120865,"externalUrl":null,"startTime":"{'blockNumber': 11120865}","endTime":"{'blockNumber': 11161185}","startTimestamp":1603566339,"endTimestamp":1604101071,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['AGAINST', 'FOR']","results":"[{'total': 1280631.2, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 37555068, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This proposal was never implemented due to other more pressing issues. After further discussion, @THEVDM1, @Snake, and I, as well as other contributors, now believe that creating and providing treasury liquidity to this Fuse pool is a risk for the treasury. This is due to a lack of liquidity in our Sushiswap YAM\/ETH pool, which would serve as the price oracle for the pool.\nAbstract - What am I proposing?\n\n## Abstract - What am I proposing?\n\nBefore deploying funds to a YAM Fuse pool, we should work to shore up the liquidity in the YAM\/ETH sushiswap pool.\n\n## Motivation - Why am I proposing it?\n\n#### Important bits from this section in the forum post:\n\n\"It is clear that the YAM\/ETH Sushiswap pool has been suffering declining liquidity over the past few months and as such it provides a much weaker oracle pricing point, which is acutely relevant to the proposed Fuse pool.\"\n\n\"With declining liquidity, price impact of trading has greatly increased and this is what attackers would use to their advantage: they have the ability to greatly influence price if they are reasonably well capitalised.\"\n\n\"Money markets such as Fuse are gas intensive. This prices out smaller users. Gas analysis is done below to prove the point that even if we were to deploy this pool, the user base would be limited to sizable borrowers\/lenders only. If the liquidity issue is to be addressed above it is recommended that a whitelisted Fuse fork: Markets.xyz is used on Polygon\/Fantom (current deployments) to recreate the pool and its parameters in the future.\"\n\n#### \"Conclusion:\n\nDo not launch the YAM Fuse Pools initially planned as the low liquidity of the YAM\/ETH pool imposes too much risk for the utility the pool would have given users.\n\n- Risk of attack through price manipulation causing a loss in treasury assets and user funds\n- Risk of poor liquidation bot coverage due to high price impact on liquidating large borrowers\n- Utility constrained by gas intensive functions required to use the pool\"\n\n## Specification\n\nThere is little that needs to be done to implement this proposal. No further work will be done on the Fuse Pools and no funds will be transferred until a new snapshot vote supercedes this one. In the mean time, contributors and community members should continue to consider ways to improve the liquidity in our YAM\/ETH pool.\n","protocol":"yam","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9098eab0a361D29Ea5c4b5d9d1f50694ac0E9e78","totalVotes":72,"blockNumber":14133538,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yam.eth\/proposal\/0x2651413f27b83847a49302ed960f9155f8844af60eb822ebf51d67e9d533037c","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1643900400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644192000}","startTimestamp":1643900400,"endTimestamp":1644192000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Pause Fuse Pool Implimentation', 'Do Not Pause Fuse Pool Impl.', 'Unsure, need more info']","results":"[{'total': 363334.3, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}

Shift the requirements to get paid to the contributors by requiring a \"request for compensation on the forum.\" Pay in both stable-coins and YAM will be distributed monthly.\n\n---\n\n### Motivation - Why am I proposing it?\nSee [this post](https:\/\/forum.yam.finance\/t\/contributor-compensation-and-transparency-report-process-change-ideas\/1583?u=ross) for the full discussion around the compensation model.\n\nIssues with the current compensation model from the linked post:\n\n- The YAM vesting doesn't work as intended: The idea of the YAM streams was for vesting to occur over a 3 month period. But this implies that the YAM earned for the last month would vested over the next 3 months. Instead, the YAM *to be earned* over the next 3 months is streamed in real time.\n- Accountability requires additional overhead from the HR group.\n- Transparency reports are not seen as important (based on how quickly they are filled out) and require that the HR group coordinates and pesters contributors to fill them out.\n- There is limited ability for contributors to work a flexible schedule that varies from month to month because the rates are set beforehand.\n- There are limited opportunities to do work via different models (bounties, milestone based compensation, etc).\n- YAM voters rely on a small group of contributors to make sure that work is being done efficiently and that all contributors are working effectively. \n- The DAO risks becoming an \"employer,\" which could lead to regulatory issues.\n- Doing all compensation via on-chain transactions via full governance adds overhead and complexity for paying contributors.\n\nMoving to a new model will clarify the interactions between contributors and the DAO, allow more transparency, and pave the way for a more decentralized future for YAM.\n\n---\n\n## Specifications - How am I proposing it is accomplished?\n\nThese changes will need to happen in multiple stages to realize the full benefits of the program. But each stage on its own will yield its own benefits. This proposal is for the first stage.\n\n### Goals\nBefore we get into the full specification, lets lay out what the goals of our contributor compensation program are.\n- The Process should be transparent for contributors and token holders.\n- Contributors should be held accountable for the work they do and not be able to \"game\" the system\n- Contributors should be fairly rewarded for their work.\n- Payment should be incentive aligned.\n- Payments should be for work that has already been done.\n- The process should require as little overhead as possible from contributors and token holders to achieve the above goals\n\n### Stage 1\n\nEnforce the following process for contributors who do work for that DAO:\n1. Those who wish to contribute to the DAO will post to the forum with their initial proposal. It should describe what they plan to work on, expertise, and an hourly rate (guidelines should be provided). This information can be ratified via snapshot voting, and is very similar to the current procedure where a contributor will \"apply\" to governance.\n\n2. At the end of a pay period (monthly), all contributors who have done work that month and wish to get paid will have 7 days (the first week of the new month) to submit a compensation request to the forum, outlining the work that they have done in the prior month and confirming the rate and total amount. These requests are like public timesheets.\n   - The requests will be reviewed before being added to the contributor payment transactions\n   - The requests also serve as transparency reports and give insight into what each contributor has been doing.\n   - Contributors who do not submit a compensation request by the deadline will not be paid in that month's transaction and will have to wait until a later transaction.\n\n3. Upon receipt and review of the reports, contributors will be paid in YAM and Stable-coins for the work they did at their pre-determined rate. Both the Stable-coin and YAM portion of their pay will be paid directly without using a stream. The price of YAM will be determined based on the 30-TWAP determined on the last day of that month. The work to create the on-chain proposal to pay contributors should take no more than 1 week (7 days). \n\n### Prerequisites to implement Stage 1.\n\n  - Determine hourly pay rates for existing contributors and ratify through snapshot.\n  - Create a general hourly pay scale for new contributors to use as a reference for future work.\n  - Create forum post template that contributors can use to submit requests for compensation.\n  - Create documents to clarify this process for contributors, developers, and community.\n\n### Addendum\nThe above is the scope of work for this stage of the update. Future stages could include:\n- Creating a multi-sig to pay contributors from.\n- Creating an optimistic governance process for the contributor payment multi-sig to allow more oversight from token holders.\n- Re-implementation of streams in a more incentive aligned and impactful way.","protocol":"yam","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9098eab0a361D29Ea5c4b5d9d1f50694ac0E9e78","totalVotes":97,"blockNumber":13972594,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yam.eth\/proposal\/0x9798a80d4e136f641a1c494d9c46a48fb7cfccf61e6d16114c798eccb5fec754","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1641747600}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1642352400}","startTimestamp":1641747600,"endTimestamp":1642352400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['YES, move forward with new model', 'NO, keep status quo', 'Resubmit proposal with changes']","results":"[{'total': 291850.7, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 4852.286, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 82381.48, 'choice': 2}]","events":"[]"}

We need to continue bootstrapping these pools to grow the Yam Synths product. At the same time, utilizing these funds in our synths earns UMA rewards for the treasury. Yam Synths products are currently earning ~49% APR on ETH, and we can expect similar (most likely higher) returns on the funds we invest.

His payment in stablecoins typically would be paid in the monthly on-chain vote with the rest of the contributor\u2019s payments.\n\nThe question here is whether the DAO thinks that Jason should receive payment for his last month of work. He has performed the work and tasks that he was given over the last month, and the exploit of which he is accused occurred on the 3rd of November, after the period of work for which he would be paid.\n\n### Motivation\nThese decisions are either beyond the scope of what the core contributors believe they should be deciding upon or are unclear on the best course of action. We feel our best way forward is to put these questions to the DAO as a whole and follow the will of the YAM token holders.\n\n### Specifications\nThe outcome of this vote will be followed by the contributors with the power to carry them out.\n\n- If the vote to pay Jason is successful, he will be paid for his work done in October in the next on-chain proposal\n- If the vote to pay Jason is unsuccessful, we will not be included the next on chain proposal.\n- If the vote fails to meet quorum then Jason will be paid for his work done in October in the next on-chain vote.\n","protocol":"yam","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9098eab0a361D29Ea5c4b5d9d1f50694ac0E9e78","totalVotes":27,"blockNumber":13578393,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yam.eth\/proposal\/0xb175abd231c2637b6ae8c10492eafab60413753ddaf2113ac05e1d2d960ebb2a","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1636412400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1636585200}","startTimestamp":1636412400,"endTimestamp":1636585200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Pay Jason for October Work', \"Don't Pay Jason for October Work\"]","results":"[{'total': 1150.0303, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 181695.73, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Beyond just generating these revenues, how they are allocated is a important consideration. With the passing of [YIP-80](https:\/\/forum.yam.finance\/t\/yip-80-yam-treasury-rebalancing\/1512), we have taken a big step creating a foundation on which we can build. Rebalancing and rationalizing the treasury is only the first step in building a strong foundation for YAM.\n\nThere have been numerous calls for a revenue\/profit distribution mechanism that benefits YAM token holders, and with a solidified model for treasury management we can now reason about how a mechanism might work.\n\nAs we are still an early stage project, any distribution mechanism should only consider profit (revenues minus expenses and returns). YAM has quarterly report in which we enumerate the inflows and outflows from the DAO. The most recent one can be seen here: \n[Yam Treasury Quarterly Report - Q2 2021](https:\/\/medium.com\/yam-finance\/yam-treasury-quarterly-report-q2-2021-23f56a758c87)\n\nUsing this information we can develop a plan to create a sustainable model to use profits to fund further growth and development.\n\n## Methodology\n\nBeyond just looking at profits and expenses for the quarter, we also need to adjust for the overall performance of the treasury between quarters. If the treasury is shrinking then there is no profit, even if our operating revenues are larger than our operating expenses. This is important because it should incentivize YAM holders to manage the treasury in a way that limits investment risk and still rewards investment growth. It also promotes revenue growth since that should be less influenced by market cycles.\n\nThere are a few metrics we can use to determine whether the DAO is profitable: Overall growth of the treasury or the difference between product revenues and DAO expenses. I believe treasury growth is the primary metric that we should use. This means that, in the context of this buyback, if the treasury did not grow in the most recent quarter then no profits were realized, even if product revenues outpaced expenses. This is the most holistic way to approach the mechanism. \n\nWe can combine a profit buyback mechanism with our need to fund the treasury with YAM to pay contributors. This would create a system where a percentage of profits are use to buy YAM off the open market, which are then used for contributor payments and incentive programs. This model, combined with the ability of the DAO to mint new YAM, provides a framework for which YamDAO can use profits generated to fund itself while also indirectly rewarding token holders, and provide a path to even eventually remove YAM from circulation.\n\n## How it would Work\nSee the Forum post here for a full write-up of the methodology: https:\/\/forum.yam.finance\/t\/yip-86-using-profit-to-buyback-and-build\/1531\n\n### Other factors\nThis model creates a number of levers through which governance can influence the project treasury and monetary policy while still prioritizing treasury and project growth. Governance would need to:\n\n1. Determine reasonable payroll and runway figures for contributor compensation. Because YAM may be minted for payroll, this is a parameter that needs to be managed. This includes setting maximum total salaries and the maximum amount of stablecoins that contributors can earn as a portion of their pay. \n2. Determine how much YAM is needed for incentive programs.\n3. Set a max yearly or quarterly YAM issuance rate for the treasury to limit overall YAM issuance.\n4. Determine the appropriate risk level for the Treasury per YIP-80\n5. Determine the `productProfitReinvestment` and `investmentProfitReinvestment` variables to set how much profit is used to buy YAM.\n\nThese different parameters will be in included in upcoming snapshot votes. This vote is intended to ratify the general concept and methodology, with further details determined in future votes.\n","protocol":"yam","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x9098eab0a361D29Ea5c4b5d9d1f50694ac0E9e78","totalVotes":69,"blockNumber":13310105,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yam.eth\/proposal\/QmSYrh4QD3iCgyGTFSMr2meRJddvBdhf9xtDbRH3y6w29A","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1632772800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1633118400}","startTimestamp":1632772800,"endTimestamp":1633118400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Approve BuyBack and Build', 'Reject Buyback and Build']","results":"[{'total': 252582.11, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 80.02842, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

To read the proposal in its entirety, please refer to the post in Yearn Governance: https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/proposal-streamlining-contributor-compensation\/12247\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nBuilds on top of the recently adopted YFI Tokenomics program to simplify Yearn contributor compensation through the introduction of a yDiscount program. Migrates and retires the previous contributor vesting and strategist compensation schemes.\n\n## Abstract\n\n**If adopted**, this proposal seeks to streamline future Yearn contributor compensation through the following steps:\n1. Establish that contributors moving forward should all be primarily compensated using the same baseline mechanism, consisting of payouts in stables.\n1. As an extension to the baseline mechanism, introduce a new method of rewarding Yearn contributors with YFI tokens, yDiscount, where:\n   * Contributors will be able to purchase discounted YFI up to their current monthly compensation level.\n   * All the purchased YFI gets locked into veYFI immediately.\n   * The discount ranges from 10-60% of current market price, determined by the duration of each contributor's veYFI lock.\n3. Retire the use of YFI vesting contracts, and migrate existing contracts to the new mechanism, giving those with remaining vests two options to choose from, either:\n   * Lock their entire remaining vesting YFI amount into veYFI for an equal or greater duration; or\n   * Release them from their vesting contracts, taking a haircut on the YFI they receive, determined by the remaining duration of their vesting package. \n4. Retire Strategist performance fee sharing, and \"buy out\" existing Strategies in production from this system:\n   * Each affected strategist receive a payout based on their net earnings from Strategies.\n   * The payout is a multiple of their average historical monthly net earnings, paid out as locked veYFI.\n   * The multiple ranges from 3-18 and is determined by the duration of their veYFI lock. \n   * Strategist total compensation (including migration) is expected to be  be more or less on the same level as before.\n5. Instruct yBudget to set funds aside for a dedicated team budget for Strategists, to be used at their discretion, including to help onboard and retain new team members.\n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n### 0. The below goes into effect with veYFI\n\n* This entire proposal is blocked by the introduction of `veYFI`, as outlined in YIP-65 (phase 2 and onwards).\n* None of these changes go into effect before veYFI has been released to production.\n* Once veYFI has been released, these changes may be implemented at the discretion of Yearn's community of contributors. \n\n### 1. Contributor compensation is streamlined to one single process that is equal to all \n\n* All frequent and regularly contributing members are paid the same way.\n* Compensation is in stablecoins, or equivalent.\n* Spending on compensation remains at the discretion of yBudget\/Treasury as per Governance 2.0.\n* Individual contributor compensation remains at the discretion of yPeople as per Governance 2.0.\n* This excludes occasional part-time grants and funding via Coordinape, which have their own separate procesess.\n\n### 2. Contributors are rewarded with YFI tokens through yDiscount \n\n* All contributors being compensated as per the previous point have the option to purchase YFI through a new yDiscount program.\n* Contributors can purchase YFI at discounts to current YFI market price, _subject to their current veYFI lock_. The longer the ve-YFI lock, the greater the discount.\n* YFI purchased through this program are immediately locked into veYFI according to the duration of their lock.\n* Contributors are only eligible to purchase YFI _up to 100% of the compensation amount they received that month_, once the discount has been factored in.\n* Once feasible, the intention is to have these operations occuring on chain each month with contributors directly interacting with smart contracts. Until then, manual off-chain calculations are used.\n* Contributors are only allowed to participate with one ethereum wallet address in the program, which can only have one single ve-YFI lock at any time. \n* Changing a participating wallet address is only permitted in exceptional circumstances and requires yPeople approval.\n* The YFI minted with YIP-57 is used to finance this program, and once this has been depleted, yBudget will allocate YFI from treasury buybacks.\n* Funds received from contributors participating in yDiscount is used for more YFI buybacks.\n* yBudget has the power to pause the yDiscount program at their discretion.\n\n#### ve-lock Discount\n\n```\n# yfi_discount: discount (%) of purchased YFI\n# ve_lock: current weeks locked in veYFI\nyfi_discount = 0.00245 * ve_lock + 0.0902\n```\n\nSo if the coming veYFI implementation is with the following parameters:\n```\nmin_lock_duration = 1 month, or 4 weeks\nmax_lock_duration = 4 years, or 208 weeks\n```\n\nThen the discount table would look as follows:\n\n| % of max lock | duration | `ve_lock` | `yfi_discount` |\n|---:|---|---:|---:|\n|1.92% | 1 month |4 | 10% |\n| 11.5% |6 months | 24 | 14.9% |\n|25% | 1 year | 52 | 21.8% |\n| 50% | 2 years | 104 | 34.5% |\n|100% | 4 years | 208 | 60% |\n\n#### YFI for purchase\n\n```\n# yfi_allowed: total YFI allowed to purchase this month\n# comp: contributor compensation in stables this month\n# yfi_price: current YFI price in stables\nyfi_allowed = comp \/ (1 - yfi_discount) * yfi_price\n```\n\n#### Example\n\nAlice is a contributor earning 3,000 DAI this month. The current price of YFI is 100,000 DAI. She has just extended her ve-lock to be 48% of max, or 99.84 weeks of 208 max possible (`ve_lock=99.84`). She therefore is entitled to purchase YFI at 33.4% discount (`yfi_discount=0.334`).\n\nAt the current price, factoring in the discount, Alice is entitled to purchase up to 0.04504504 YFI this way.\n\nAlice decides to spend 1500 DAI to purchase 0.02252252 YFI this month, which immediately becomes locked into veYFI according to her existing lock.\n\n### 3. Retire & Migrate YFI vesting contracts\n\n1. Vesting contracts are no longer offered to contributors by default, and are only to be used in exceptional circumstances. Instead, yDiscount is the default method of YFI compensation.\n1. Existing YFI vesting contract are migrated and closed down, with recipients having the choice of one of two options:\n   1. **Full migration into veYFI.** If the contributor sets a veYFI lock that is equal or longer than their existing vesting package, 100% of their remaining vest is locked into veYFI.\n      \n      _Example: Bob has 1.5 years remaining to vest 9.731 YFI. Bob creates a veYFI lock of 2 years. The full 9.731 YFI is locked on his behalf into his veYFI lock._\n   3. **Exit vesting package with a haircut.** For every 1 week remaining of a vesting package, the recipient takes a 0.25% haircut, and is paid out the remaining in unlocked YFI that they can do whatever they please with.\n      \n      _Example: Carol has 98.321 weeks left to vest 18.821 YFI. She takes a 24.58% haircut (`98.321 x 0.25`) and is paid out 14.19 YFI._  \n\n### 4. Retire Strategist performance fee sharing and buy out existing Strategies\n\n1. Strategy authors are no longer offered the 10% performance fee share for new strategies that get deployed to Production, instead Treasury receives the full 2% management fee and 20% performance fee.\n1. Strategists are compensated the same way as any other contributor: stablecoins + yOption system.\n1. Strategies already in Production and earning 10% performance fee are \"bought out\" using the following scheme:\n   * Earn `x` times previously averaged monthly earnings from the strategy, paid out as veYFI, where `x` depends on the veYFI lock: \n        ```\n        # buy_out: total amount of YFI to be locked in the strategist's veYFI\n        # net_earnings: strategist's average monthly earnings the past 6 months\n        # x: multiple, depending on strategist's excisting veYFI lock\n        # YFI_price: current YFI price in stables\n        buy_out = (net_earnings * x) \/ yfi_price\n        ```\n\n        | % of max lock | duration | `ve_lock` | `x` |\n        |---:|---|---:|---:|\n        | < 12.5% | no lock or < 6 months | < 26 | 3 |\n        | 12.5% |6 months | 26 | 6 |\n        |25% | 1 year | 52 | 9 |\n        | 50% | 2 years | 104 | 12 |\n        |100% | 4 years | 208 | 18 |\n        \n       In other words, if a Strategist creates a veYFI lock for four years, they receive 18 months of their averaged earnings paid out as veYFI locked for four years.\n\n   * Average monthly earnings is calculated as an average of the past six months, and is done with the help of each individual strategist, where __net earnings__ is calculated. Net earnings would include earnings from other strategies, committees, or strategists, and exclude payments made to committees, or strategists.\n\n   _Example: David is a strategist with 2 strategies in Production and is also member of a committee. He donates 5% of his earnings to the Strategist Multisig. Looking back over the last 6 months, David's net earnings was on average $45,500\/month. David creates a veYFI lock of 2 years. YFI\/USD is $35,000. David receives 15.6 veYFI that are locked for 2 years._\n\n### 5. Establish a dedicated team budget for Strategists\n\n1. As a replacement for the donations to the Strategist Multisig, yBudget are instructed to set funds aside for a dedicated team budget for Strategists.\n2. This can go to the existing Strategist Multisig wallet, no changes to signers are required.\n3. Funds are to be used at the discretion of the Strategists, including to help onboard and retain new team members, but also any other activity that is not in conflict with Yearn spending policies. \n\n## References\n\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/yip-65-evolving-yfi-tokenomics\/11994#future-possibilities-11\n1. https:\/\/coordinape.com\/\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/yip-52-make-strategist-skin-in-game-partner-for-make-benefit-of-glorious-brain-of-yearn\/7856\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/yip-54-formalize-operations-funding\/7956\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/yip-57-funding-yearns-future\/9319\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/yearn-retention-packages\/9698\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/yip-61-governance-2-0\/10460","protocol":"ybaby","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x7A1057E6e9093DA9C1D4C1D049609B6889fC4c67","totalVotes":181,"blockNumber":14148129,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/ybaby.eth\/proposal\/0x804d3765e70d6e4f0f0a225222dadd396cd328595d5fd097b732b36fdf8e6af6","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1644096621}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1644528621}","startTimestamp":1644096621,"endTimestamp":1644528621,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, I support this proposal', \"No, I'm against this proposal\"]","results":"[{'total': 476.02945, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 1.0009419, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Direct a portion of YFI that is bought back by the Treasury as a result of BABY [[1]](#References) as rewards to those YFI token holders who actively participate in Yearn Governance.\n1. Evolve the role YFI plays in Yearn Governance through four distinct components. These build on top of each other and thus come in a particular order:\n   * **1: xYFI.** Distribute YFI that's been bought back with Treasury tokens as rewards in a YFI vault. \n   * **2: Vote-locked YFI.** Introduce ve-style locking of YFI (veYFI) for up to four years (exact max duration tbd), where a longer locking duration gives a greater share of voting power and share of YFI rewards. An early exit from the lock is possible by paying a penalty that is rewarded to the other locked token holders. \n   * **3: Vault Gauges + Voting.** Introduce _vault gauges_ where vault depositors stake their vault tokens and earn YFI rewards according to their veYFI weight. YFI are allocated to gauges based on weekly governance votes. \n   * **4: \"Useful work\" features.** Expand the duties and responsibilities of veYFI voters, and their locked YFI, in exchange for earning additional protocol rewards. Pending the tbc v3 vault design.\n1. Give the mandate to Yearn Developers to roll out the above components at their discretion as and when they become feasible.\n1. Restrict the YFI eligible to vote in Yearn Governance as only those staked in xYFI (from Phase 1 and onwards) or vote-locked in Yearn (from Phase 2 and onwards).\n\n## Background\n\n(This section was cut due to Snapshot character limit. Find the full text of the proposal [on the forum](https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/proposal-evolving-yfi-tokenomics\/11994))\n \n## Motivation\n\n### Benefits\n\nThe following are some of the properties where the new tokenomics design is believed to improve over the previous state:\n* **Incorporates YFI buybacks.** The mandate of YIP-56 is unchanged, the new design builds on top of and integrates  the bought back YFI.\n* **Is a sustainable ecosystem.** The new design does not create a drain on Treasury assets. Instead there are reinforcing flywheel effects where tokenomics rewards drive more TVL, that in turn drive more fees, that in turn drive more YFI buybacks, that is then used to reinforce the tokenomics.\n* **Incentivizes a long term view on Yearn.** Token holders are motivated to support the protocol over the longer term rather than to speculate in the short term.\n* **Disproportionately rewards those most loyal.** Weaker conviction holders effectively become diluted over time by the stronger conviction holders.\n* **Limits rent-seeking benefits.** Over time as the components are introduced, the design avoids holders being rewarded for nothing. Or letting the largest holders accumulate more at the expense of the smaller holders.\n* **Makes vaults more competitive.** Additional YFI earned from vault gauges are effectively added yield for depositors, in proportion to how dedicated they are in their support. \n* **Motivates 3rd party protocols and DAOs to become YFI holders.** Yearn products are used as a yield components of a broader DeFi stack, and integrated in wallets and protocols. With this design, they have incentives to direct rewards to vaults and products they are using.\n* **A seamless experience for integrators.** Participation is _optional_. This maintains the simplicity integrators have come to appreciate and makes it easy to reason about vault behavior. Only those who are motivated to do so can participate.\n\n### Future possibilities\nThe proposal also opens up doors for potential further improvements that extend or build on top of these concepts, including: \n* **yOptions program for contributors**, where contributors can acquire YFI at a discount based on how long these are locked into the protocol for.\n* **Insurance\/Backstop functionality**, where vaults could be insured against loss based on the amount of YFI locked, which in turn could be used to draw up stablecoin CDPs to repay users in catastrophic events. \n* **New YFI Emission to veYFI holders**, where new YFI is minted according to some emission schedule and used to reward veYFI holders based on their lock duration. \n* **Partnership program adopting veYFI to boost partner performance**, where partners can earn more based on their veYFI size and lock duration.\n\n### Risks\n\n* **Governance attacks,** where one or several actors accumulate sizable positions of YFI and can control rewards and decisions of the protocol. These risks exist  today, and are mitigated somewhat by the limited supply of YFI and how the strong demand for YFI amongst Yearn contributors makes such attacks costly.   \n* **Not enough rewards to make locking attractive,** where vaults may not generate enough tokens to the Treasury to buy back enough YFI to motivate YFI holders to lock into veYFI. This has somewhat of a balancing effect, where as demand for locking decreases, so does the share of the rewards for those who actually do lock. If it's determined that the equilibrium does not lead to enough YFI being locked, additional YFI could be minted and rewarded to veYFI holders as previously mentioned in \"Future possibilities\".\n* **YFI liquidity dries up.** Currently YFI is traded on multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges. As demand for using YFI elsewhere grows, there may be a lack of YFI\/ETH LP supply in liquidity pools and lack of interest in general YFI market making, leading to YFI becoming more illiquid. In such an event, additional incentives may be required in order to ensure a healthy liquidity exists for trading in and out of YFI. The Treasury may also explore owning some of this liquidity outright.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n* OlympusPRO style designs\n* Voters voting on fees\n* YFI as a fee discount\n* Distribute treasury YFI \n\n## Specification\n\n### 1. Spend bought back YFI in tokenomics rewards\n- Use a portion of bought back YFI from BABY to finance a new tokenomics program.\n- The 6,666 YFI that were minted as part of YIP-57: Funding Yearn's Future[[9]](#References) are not used for this purpose.\n\n### 2. Evolve YFI through four components\n\n_In required order:_\n\n#### 2.1 xYFI\n- A typical Yearn vault with YFI as a want token (potentially repurposing the existing yvYFI vault).\n- Receives bought back YFI as rewards.\n- Does not have any locking requirement.\n- Does not charge fees.\n\n![xYFI diagram](https:\/\/svgshare.com\/i\/cu9.svg)\n\n#### 2.2 Vote-locked YFI\n- Locking similar to the ve-style program of Curve.\n- YFI can be locked up to 4 years into veYFI, which is non-transferable.\n- The maximum lock duration is still tbd, but will be in the range of min 1 year, max 4 years.\n- Locking duration gives the same linear weights, so if max duration is 4 years, this is 100%, and 2 years = 50% etc.\n- Weights decay as the remaining lock duration decreases, and can be extended up to the max lock duration.\n- Replaces xYFI, where a user _must_ have a veYFI lock in order to continue to earn rewards. No lock leads to no rewards. Maximum lock, continuously renewed, maximizes rewards.\n- It's possible to exit the lock early, in exchange for paying a penalty that gets allocated to the other veYFI holders.\n- Penalty size may be fixed (i.e. 50%), or may be depending on the remaining lock duration. \n\n![veYFI diagram](https:\/\/svgshare.com\/i\/cta.svg)\n\n#### 2.3 Vault gauges + Voting\n- Vault gauges allow vault depositors to stake their vault tokens and earn YFI rewards according to their veYFI weight.\n- YFI are allocated to gauges based on weekly governance votes. Each gauge can get a different amount of bought back YFI to emit.\n- Based on their veYFI lock, users can boost their rewards of up to 2.5x proportional to the amount of vault tokens deposited, when they claim YFI rewards from gauges. The greater the amount of veYFI, the more vault deposits can be boosted for the user. \n- Inspired by Andre Cronje's initial design of Fixed Forex[[10]](#References), in order for gauge rewards to be claimed, the user must have a veYFI lock. Depending on their lock duration, they are entitled to a different share of gauge rewards: if max lock = 4 years, and user is locked for 4 years, they are entitled to 100% of their rewards, if user is locked for 2 years = 50% of rewards, if user has no lock = 0% of their rewards. The difference is paid as penalty to veYFI holders, as an additional source of yield.\n\n![gauges diagram](https:\/\/svgshare.com\/i\/cst.svg)\n\n#### 2.4 \"Useful work\" features\n- This is driven by requirements of the yearn v3 vault design (still tbd).\n- veYFI holders would be able to do useful work for the protocol and earn greater rewards as a result.\n- Examples of useful work could be, but does not necessarily have to be: Configuring vault parameters, vault fees, strategy allocations, providing vault insurance, protocol backstop, and many other additional functionality.\n- No useful work will be introduced without consulting YFI voters beforehand through YIPs.\n\n### 3 Give Yearn Developers the mandate to roll out the above components\n- Components can be introduced based on the requirements as set out here, with minor modifications as deemed necessary.\n- Exact setting of parameters such as max lock duration and penalty system is left to be set at the discretion of the implementers.  \n- There is no requirement to add all four components, but components need to be in the order outlined as they build on each other.\n- Timelines are at the discretion of the contributors doing the implementation work.\n\n### 4 Restrict the YFI eligible to vote\n- Once xYFI is introduced, only YFI staked is eligible to vote in Yearn Governance.\n- Once veYFI is introduced, only veYFI is accepted voting power in Yearn Governance. \n\n\n## References\n\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/yip-56-buyback-and-build\/8929\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/call-for-ideas-yfi-tokenomics-revamp\/11573\n1. https:\/\/px2hc2blifd.typeform.com\/report\/yj5p5iIo\/zIj0Alc03WFWfKTg\n1. https:\/\/yearn.snapshot.page\/#\/proposal\/0x783cb3d57dd59b2827f6a42967375f06504cc947ebaa3c0e495c7b29ffd47aea\n1. https:\/\/github.com\/yearn\/yearn-security\/blob\/master\/disclosures\/2021-02-04.md\n1. https:\/\/github.com\/yearn\/yearn-pm\/tree\/master\/financials\/reports\n1. https:\/\/twitter.com\/bantg\/status\/1461910717494398983\n1. https:\/\/www.yfistats.com\/financials\/YFIBuybacks.html (Page 2)\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/yip-57-funding-yearns-future\/9319\n1. https:\/\/andrecronje.medium.com\/fair-launches-decentralized-collaboration-and-fixed-forex-ab327a2e4fc4","protocol":"ybaby","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x7A1057E6e9093DA9C1D4C1D049609B6889fC4c67","totalVotes":426,"blockNumber":13859920,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/ybaby.eth\/proposal\/0x8f7417fa5565d9f46e16618503e8808c36d51b2a9e8217a68c632d7c090d69d9","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1640246581}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1640678581}","startTimestamp":1640246581,"endTimestamp":1640678581,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, I support this proposal', \"No, I'm against this proposal\"]","results":"[{'total': 907.40594, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 2.9126709, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

As each option requires more development work, please consider each proposal a general direction and not a final product.\n\nThis poll will be by weighted voting - you can split your YFI between the different options.\n\n\n## Option A - ySplit\nThe YFI token is limited to 36,666 tokens, with 1 YFI is valued at 6 ETH or $25k USDC. There is a perception that unit bias is a barrier to token investors.\n\nThe ySplit proposal removes the impact of unit bias by issuing a multiple (10,000 to 1,000,000) of new YFI tokens proportionately to YFI token holders. This proposal will have a once-off cost (development, comms, audits, gas) and will a token contract migration.\n\nMore detail here:  [ySPLIT](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1dAWTkS_ZsXNy7mKKjOFUjILSlLsLz9KhGfLrwVu0GUg\/)\n\n## Option B - veYFI\nTreasury earnings are accumulated and used to buy and hold YFI tokens, with the option of spending these on the development of the yearn.finance ecosystem. This reduces circulating supply if spending is less than earnings but there are no guarantees that these holdings will not be spent.\n\nThe veYFI option proposes a token locking mechanism modelled from veCRV. YFI holders can stake and lock their tokens for a period of up to 4 years, and in return will receive voting rights (via veYFI tokens) on the distribution of treasury earnings to yearn vaults. The BABY mechanism continues to buy YFI using treasury earnings but the deployment of the earnings is altered as follows:\n\n- An operational treasury is maintained in stablecoins with a minimum balance of $30m\n- Excess treasury revenue is directed back into vaults as gauge rewards, with the gauge weight determined by veYFI holders in weekly voting rounds.\n\nIt is anticipated that this will incentivise accumulation of veYFI for voting rights, and spawn a Curve-like ecosystem with bribes and entities like Convex.\n\nWith YFI protocol returns at around 9.5% APR, there may be a requirement for further issuance of YFI tokens (Curve-like emissions) to properly incentivise locking of YFI for multi-year periods.  This will be subject to future analysis if this proposal proceeds.\n\nMore detail here: [veYFI draft proposal WIP](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1hoi-IVccOB6iUJYzuApVbyjbQBx8-M0UuzZosb9wlWM)\n\n## Option C - xYFI\nxYFI is similar to veYFI, however instead of vote locking tokens, there is a YFI staking vault (xYFI) to which excess treasury revenue is directed. The BABY mechanism continues to buy YFI using treasury earnings but the deployment of earnings is altered as follows:\n- An operational treasury is maintained in stablecoins with a minimum balance of $30m\n- The vault operates in a similar manner to a Yearn vault, however instead of strategies the revenue comes as YFI from the BABY buybacks.\n\nThe purpose of the xYFI vault is to reward stakers for removing their YFI from circulation by giving them a share of protocol revenue. \n\nMore detail here: [xYFI proposal draft](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1ev16BXu3bDC8zMSBvHmxMWIeD82ptZck6SJAO5frV5g\/)\n\n## Option D - BurnKeYs\n\nThe YFI token supply is 36,666 tokens. There is nothing preventing YFI holders from voting to mint more tokens at any point in the future leading to a perception that the YFI supply is not limited.\n\nThe BurnKeYs option proposes to permanently disable the mint functionality of the YFI token contract, permanently capping the supply to the number of tokens issued at the time.\n\nMore detail here: [BurnKeYs](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1BqmRsfdfCIaCtNZULdhKqUJzpKdaHE1XOGQlVp2nuSc)\n\n## Option E - Status Quo\n\nThis proposal keeps the YFI tokenomics as they are now, and proposes a campaign to inform YFI holders and potential investors of the benefits of the current tokenomics system. Many of these ideas have been discussed in #status-quo.\n\n### Interactions\n\nIf ySplit proceeds, it will occur before any other successful proposal.  BurnKeYs will occur after any other proposal.  veYFI and BurnKeYs may be mutually exclusive if further emissions are required.  veYFI and xYFI are mutually exclusive.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nThis proposal is the result of lots of input and work from the community:\n0x_bear, onlylarping, BraveNewDefi + Iguana & Owl, HatTip3675, Reese, defiglenn, bobe, J-yhelper, bfs, Vany, scottincrypto & fin4dao","protocol":"ybaby","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x1AEC250C13b1214C4B9935Db3C8a7610fdAaE8dD","totalVotes":141,"blockNumber":13761408,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/ybaby.eth\/proposal\/0x783cb3d57dd59b2827f6a42967375f06504cc947ebaa3c0e495c7b29ffd47aea","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1638922900}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1639354900}","startTimestamp":1638922900,"endTimestamp":1639354900,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['ySplit', 'veYFI', 'xYFI', 'BurnKeYs', 'Status Quo']","results":"[{'total': 544.07965, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 6.0780306, 'choice': 1}, {'total': 4.5600395, 'choice': 2}, {'total': 283.68695, 'choice': 4}, {'total': 0.00084999995, 'choice': 5}, {'total': 0.22611551, 'choice': 9}, {'total': 0.56579256, 'choice': 16}, {'total': 91.255005, 'choice': 24}, {'total': 0.0024185197, 'choice': 29}, {'total': 0.01199564, 'choice': 32}, {'total': 10.502251, 'choice': 49}, {'total': 19.86935, 'choice': 99}]","events":"[]"}

Since the heights of \"DeFi Summer\" yield has slowed down on the Ethereum mainnet, and it has become common for non-stablecoin crypto assets to return in the lower single-digit APRs.\n\n#### Opportunity Cost of High Fees\nThe current 2% management fee is a flat rate taken from invested assets over the course of a year. Therefore, if a strategy is earning 2.5% APR or less (after combined mgmt + performance fees), users stand to realize no profit on harvest. Yearn tries to avoid deploying funds in these situations which are unprofitable to users. The downsides to this are:\n- all farms which earn between 0% - 2.5% APR become non-viable strategies\n- in these situations, treasury earns no fee income\n- creates additional management burden on Yearn operations to actively monitor strategy APR and react when it dips too low.\n\nFinding 2.5%+ APR farms for crypto assets like ETH and BTC is difficult, especially for the scale Yearn operates at. Lowering the management fees on these tokens will help improve APR while also creating access to new farms.\n\n#### Maintain Protocol Revenue by Shifting to Performance fee\nFor lower performing vaults, performance fees are a more attractive option because . to anything below 100% will not result in users earning 0% (or less) on a harvest as fees are charged from profits rather than the initial deposit. This is a straight forward way to balance the reduction of the management fee.\n\n#### More to come...\nThis proposal is viewed as a temporary measure to take action and collect data while further ideas for fee revisions are discussed by the community.\n\n### **Data for claims**\nThe image below shows sample data for 2\/20 versus the proposed 1\/25 fee structure across a range of yield scenarios.\n\n![](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/4562643\/142752872-6e34b82b-387d-4fd1-b6a6-2978af146938.png)\nSource: [Fee Adjustment Calculator](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1U66cFgymIW4Qdmo3lgCx5-lrMunBbLI_6cbxplWAE1U\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Increasing profitability for yVaults with lower yield:**\n\nThe proposed fee structure change provides a very tangible benefit for low earning vaults, with diminishing results as APY increases. This is why it makes sense for the adjustment to be isolated to crypto native asset yVaults rather than all yVaults in general. When a vault is earning above 30% APY, this fee change actually reduces profit for users. \n\n**Reduce treasury income:** \n\nAdversely, the proposed fee change would have a greater impact on the treasury when applied to lower earning vaults. Still, percentage wise, the benefit to token holders greatly outweighs the loss of the treasury. \n\nAdditionally, since the lower earning vaults aren\u2019t bringing in as many fees as an equivalent TVL higher earning vault, the relative loss of treasury revenue will be negligible when compared to the benefits. \n\n\n## Specification\n\nAdjustments to vault management and performance fees require transactions from the governance multisig (`ychad.eth`). If passed, the following should take effect.\n\n**Non-stablecoin yVaults**\n\n- 1% annualized management\n    - Full amount allocated to Treasury\n    - Applied only to invested funds\n    - Collected on each harvest\n- 25% performance fee\n    - 15% allocated to Treasury\n    - 10% allocated to the Strategist\n\n**Stablecoin yVaults:** (unchanged)\n\n---\n\n**For**: Introduce 1% mgmt and 25% performance fee structure on non-stablecoin yVaults, leaving fees on stablecoin yVaults unchanged.\n**Against**: Do nothing","protocol":"ybaby","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x7A1057E6e9093DA9C1D4C1D049609B6889fC4c67","totalVotes":448,"blockNumber":13656678,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/ybaby.eth\/proposal\/0xfe7296601d199b89a8aa53f95d6243ef935d736bea2f13109979d8d5098017d2","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1637481581}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1637913581}","startTimestamp":1637481581,"endTimestamp":1637913581,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['For', 'Against']","results":"[{'total': 168.01187, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 307.01547, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

The LeXpunK_DAO will be governed by builders from contributing communities (including yearn) and practicing lawyers from the [LeXpunK Army](https:\/\/judge-jowday.medium.com\/rise-of-lexpunk-army-5afad79966f1). 5% of the current supply of L3X, the non-transferable reputational token of the LeXpunK Army, would be airdropped to YFI holders who support this proposal, to enable direct sentiment polling on relevant legal issues from the Yearn community.  LeXpunK will effect additional airdrops from time to time, proportionally in line with the relative contributions of other builder communities, with the goal of forming a broad coalition to pool resources for funding shared advocacy goals. \n\n## Motivation\/Rationale\n\nGrowing mainstream awareness of DeFi is coinciding with institutional outrage over the \"Wall St. Bets\" phenomenon and political change in the United States to brew a perfect storm of aggressive legal threats against DeFi:\n\n* mainstream media calls DeFi a \"[shadow financial market](https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2021\/07\/24\/shadow-financial-market-spooks-regulators-500696)\" and warns that regulatory action is imminent\n* new SEC Chair Gary Gensler concludes [a recent speech](https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/sec-chairman-says-cryptocurrency-falls-under-security-based-swaps-rules) to the American Bar Association Derivatives and Futures Law Committee with a warning that many DeFi platforms may involve securities swaps\n* CFTC Commissioner Dan Berkovitz, having googled DeFi, [positioned it](https:\/\/www.cryptoglobe.com\/latest\/2021\/06\/cftc-commissioner-dan-berkovitz-is-concerned-about-decentralized-finance-defi\/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIn%20a%20pure%20'peer%2D,customers%20whole%20when%20processes%20fail.) as being squarely incompatible with the policy of 'mandatory intermediation' enshrined in CFTC regulations on leveraged retail commodities transactions and commodities swaps and referenced unfair advantages DeFi has to TradFi due to the lack of regulated intermediaries\n* many blue-chip DeFi projects have already been [called in front of regulators](https:\/\/africa.businessinsider.com\/markets\/us-regulators-are-reportedly-meeting-with-defi-companies-as-scrutiny-of-crypto-builds\/1gqq2kc) or are [receiving SEC subpoenas](https:\/\/twitter.com\/arrington\/status\/1418314425795231754) and are forming organized political lobbying efforts which may have distinct and zero-sum goals\n\nDeFi is a DAO of DAOs. These DAOs have many shared goals. For instance, we all aim to build, use, and enjoy open financial technologies. However, DAOs also compete with one another and often differ in ethos and strategy. \n\nExisting advocacy orgs like the Blockchain Association, Coin Center, and the Uniswap-funded DeFi Education Fund have mutually overlapping membership and staff which are heavily intertwined with Silicon Valley venture capital funds and traditional crypto businesses like Coinbase. Many of the teams most directly represented by these organizations have pursued dual token\/equity strategies, which means they also seek to accrue value to their equityholders through KYC-gated and censorable forks of their protocols which will cater to institutions and 'fintechs'. \n\nBuilder-centric, bottom-up communities like Yearn, Curve, and SushiSwap have a different cultural ethos and a different story to tell. We are spontaneous, cryptonative communities of builders that have no TradFi backup plan and value openness, lack of hierarchy, and creativity above all else. Thus, we should have our own unique voice in the evolving regulatory landscape, and by doing so we may be able to make or emphasize lines of legal argument that are not as available to other kinds of projects. After all, the former head of the SEC's CorpFin division [views \"sufficient decentralization\" as the point where traditional regulations end](https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/news\/speech\/speech-hinman-061418), and there is nothing more decentralized than a community of builders, users and investors that come together with no contracts or rules, no board of directors or stockholders to answer to, yet somehow build remarkable innovations together. \n\nWe believe that cryptolaw should be done in the crypto spirit. If DeFi communities want to show regulators, lawyers, and politicians what is special about DeFi, then Orwellian-named trade associations and non-profits staffed by D.C. insiders are not the best way to go. Instead, we should present ourselves as we are--as DAOs, as token communities, as builder communities. The values underlying these modes of expression are too important to cast aside in the name of expediency when the going gets tough and there are legal threats. On the contrary, the values of openness, transparency, and decentralization are DeFi's greatest defense to traditional regulation and should be front-and-center when regulators and politicians interface with DeFi communities. This is why [LeXpunK](https:\/\/lex-node.medium.com\/lexpunk-a1bb9f769ec) was created--to bring lawyers and builders together under a shared ethos that is as disruptive to law as it is to finance. \n\nThrough a new, community-funded LeXpunK_DAO, we will not merely hire existing lawyers or fund existing traditional advocacy groups--We will bootstrap a new community of lawyers and builders working side-by-side to legitimize and protect shared creative values. This community will become a flywheel unto itself and yield benefits long after these initial donations are spent and far beyond the benefits of the specific projects these donations end up funding. \n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nLeXpunK_DAO will mix long-term strategic advocacy campaigns with rapid-response 'guerilla lawfare' raids. LeXpunK_DAO will be structured either as a Moloch DAO, Gnosis multisig, or other DAO implementation; in any case, with balanced representation of LeXpunK Army members and representatives of the contributing DeFi communities. Un-committed contributed funds will be 'ragequittable' at the discretion of each community's representatives. We estimate that $1M from Yearn and $1M from Curve would provide a sufficient starting point to get the ball rolling (this is far less than the massive warchest recently raised from Uniswap to fund already heavily VC-\/Silicon-Valley-backed advocates). \n\n#### A. Campaigns\n\nCampaigns are major strategic initiatives, such as: \n* a landmark position paper advocating for positive analysis under securities law, commodities law or tax law of Yearn-relevant DeFi primitives such as flash loans, vault strategies, CDPs, and deposit-claim tokens (e.g., yAssets) \n* a legal defense of DeFi developers against regulatory litigation;\n* proposed 'safe harbor' legislation legalizing key aspects of DeFi; \n* if\/when the SEC files a case premised on a novel, expansive view of securities laws that could adversely affect DeFi builders (for example, that all project participants are collectively responsible as an '[unincorporated association](https:\/\/lawstreetmedia.com\/tech\/sec-charges-five-in-connection-with-2b-bitconnect-securities-offering\/)'); the LeXpunK_DAO would file an *amicus curiae* brief in the litigation\n\nCampaigns will be defined with thorough specifications and funded with pre-announced bounties. Campaign fulfillment will be by teams hand-picked by the Advocacy Fund Multisig. Relevant experts--both lawyers and developers--will be recruited from within the LeXpunK community, other DeFi communities and, if needed, from traditional law firms; these will be our 'MandDAOlorians' working for a piece of the bounty. A 'taskmaster' will be assigned from the most trusted ranks of the LeXpunK Army--typically an experienced attorney--who is not eligible for the bounty, but receives a flat fee to monitor the working group's progress, help remove blockers and make the final determination of when the project has been completed to spec and the bounty is due to be paid. Upon project completion, the team members themselves will decide how the bounty should be allocated, using another yearn ecosystem offshoot--[coordinape](https:\/\/coordinape.com\/). Campaigns will be pre-checked with the LeXpunK community through L3X snapshot polls. \n\n#### B. Raids\n\nRaids are rapid-response initiatives tailored to respond to current events in realtime.

Thus, before the expiration date, YFI holders should approve a new proposal to establish the future direction of yearn governance. This YIP constitutes such a proposal and, if approved, would supersede YIP-41 and ratify yearn's current *de facto* operational governance practices. \n\n\n# Specification\n\n## Governance 2.0 Overview\nWe present here the first phase of a progressive decentralization and improvement to yearn's governance. This proposal seeks to update the decision-making structures within yearn, not their software implementation. It is our intent to offer implementation proposals in the future once this model is validated and the appropriate technologies become available for use.\n\n![Gov 2.0 v1|1711x2140,30%](https:\/\/ipfs.io\/ipfs\/QmaEE5xzSf328dnKq7LxSrHsYcUB5AVpDByhAr7oBzB9fR) \n\nYearn is a network of independent doers united by a shared vision. Our bias is on action over bureaucracy. We move fast with great freedom and agency. This is our way. Towards this end, we have pioneered a method of governance we call 'constrained delegation' whereby YFI holders delegate their governance powers to autonomous groups like the Multisig and yTeams and thus empower them to be creative. Gov 2.0 takes that a step farther by making governance powers discrete and transferable objects under the direct control of YFI holders.\n\n. . . \n\n# Complete Proposal\nDue to the character limit for Snapshot, the complete text of this proposal cannot be posted here.

It would be beneficial to agree on a general approach that outlines how these situations are to be handled. \n\n### Airdrop factors\n\n* **Cost to claim.** Claiming airdrops can involve manual work, sometimes on different chains than Ethereum, for uncertain rewards. \n* **Time periods to claim.** Claiming may at times be done in one go, and other times over multiple times, sometimes lasting as long as a year or more. \n* **Relationships and image.** Acting in bad faith, i.e. \"claiming & dumping\" can lead to exclusion from future airdrops, bad publicity, and being labeled as an adversary rather than a partner.\n* **Tokenomics.** Depending on the protocol design, there can be lucrative farming opportunities or heavy penalties to incentivize good actors in the airdrop protocol. Considering these can lead to better rewards. \n\n## Motivation\n\nThe rationale for this proposal is motivated by the following objectives:\n* **Do right by the vault's depositors.** In principle, airdrops belong to whoever holds the private key. Practically, many vault depositors expect to benefit from airdrop proceeds. Yearn should do right by them, which in turn does good for Yearn's reputation and attracts more users of its products.\n* **Set expectations straight.** At the moment, it is unclear what will happen in airdrop situations. Vault depositors should have clarity about what they should expect to happen.\n* **Do not overload Yearn's resources.** Yearn's vaults are different, and airdrops are different. Subjective judgement about which airdrop to claim, and what the best way for realising it, is unavoidably going to be required. Airdrops should not end up becoming an effective Denial-of-Service attack on Yearn teams and distract them from delivering on existing roadmaps and priorities. \n* **Keep it simple.** Yearn is meant to make DeFi simple, and should try to live up to that. Depositing a token into a Yearn vault shouldn't come with expectations of potentially having to deal with the handling of other unrelated tokens, possibly even accessible from other blockchains.\n* **Keep it composable.** Yearn vaults are being used by end users, defi protocols, businesses, and other intelligent life such as smart contracts and robots. They should benefit from airdrops automatically, without no additional effort, letting rewards compound. This avoids unexpected behaviour and edge cases, making Yearn's vaults easier to integrate with.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. A decision is made whether the effort to claim a specific airdrop is worth while given  other current priorities.\n2. Specific claiming, farming, and token exchange strategies are determined on a case by case basis, depending on prevailing airdrop terms and market conditions, with the objective to maximize risk-adjusted returns.\n3. Returns are used to boost the returns of the affected vault for the benefit of its current depositors. This is done by converting the returns into `want` tokens, and donating them to the vault in question, boosting the returns of each current tokenholder as a result.\n4. Decisions on the details of the above steps are left to be taken by the Operations, Engineering, and Finance teams with the instruction to meet these instructions as best as possible. Decisions can be overruled as usual through the existing Multi-sig and Governance processes. Both groups should be kept up to date on airdrop claims as they progress.\n\n\n## Vote\n* **Yes**, I support this proposal.\n* **No**, I'm against this proposal.\n\n## References\n1. https:\/\/ellipsisfinance.medium.com\/introducing-ellipsis-finance-735cba834e91\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/discussion-what-to-do-with-eps-airdrop\/10254\n1. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/proposal-airdrops-to-yearn-vaults\/10356","protocol":"ybaby","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x7A1057E6e9093DA9C1D4C1D049609B6889fC4c67","totalVotes":0,"blockNumber":12196456,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/ybaby.eth\/proposal\/QmNqAqRKMFcoRjaRYAKCVETij6sjJ4S1293kbpYDMVvcjB","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1617849000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1618281000}","startTimestamp":1617849000,"endTimestamp":1618281000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes, support', 'No, oppose']","results":"[]","events":"[]"}

This is done in order for a currently in-progress governance architecture proposal to mature further, and ultimately have longer time to be discussed in the community, prior to it being proposed. \n\n## Rationale\n\nThe existing mandate expires on February 24 2021. As is stated in YIP-41, the Multisig was empowered for rapid decision making until the protocol transitioned to a \"multi-DAO structure\". A plan to decentralize power away from the Multisig, led by @tracheopteryx, is in-progress of being finalized. It has been delayed due to  recent Governance activities.\n\nThe three month extension would be used to introduce the proposal to the wider community, iterate on it further to incorporate feedback, without being rushed by the somewhat arbitrary deadline that the mandate expiration sets.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n#### Rush the new governance proposal\n\nOne alternative would have been to instead publish the current draft of the proposal as is, and hurry to have it adopted by YFI voters before the existing empowerment expires on February 24. The outcome of this process is uncertain. It is likely to result in a less mature YIP being adopted, if one is adopted at all.\n\n#### Let mandate expire, replace with some alternative \n\nAnother alternative would be to let the Multisig mandate expire, and be replaced by some other Governance alternative. It is unlikely that a feasible alternative solution could be devised, proposed, and finalized in the little time that remains before expiry.  \n\n## Specification\n\n* Extend the current Multisig authority and remit as was granted by YIP-41 for an additional three months, expiring on **May 24 2021**.\n* **Do not** change or modify the existing mandate in any way.\n* Any changes made by YIPs adopted after YIP-41 still apply.\n* Further changes to the mandate can be made through Yearn's Governance process.\n\n## References\n\n1. https:\/\/yips.yearn.finance\/YIPS\/yip-41","protocol":"ybaby","adapter":"archive","proposer":"0x7A1057E6e9093DA9C1D4C1D049609B6889fC4c67","totalVotes":1757,"blockNumber":11884857,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yearn\/proposal\/QmdRCXH6BQpNcucoZqAtS5hQKjckE2428qiZoWjxmJXbs3","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1613705100}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1614137100}","startTimestamp":1613705100,"endTimestamp":1614137100,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 379.59198, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 0.0005, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Mint 6,666 YFI. Use ~1\/3 of minted YFI to reward key contributors and put ~2\/3 of minted YFI in the Treasury under the control of the community through future proposals. \n\n# Abstract\n\n**If adopted**, this proposal seeks to:\n\n1. Mint 6,666 YFI.\n2. Allocate ~1\/3 of the minted YFI to key contributors as vesting retention packages.\n3. Allocate the remaining ~2\/3 to the Treasury, which will be deployed through existing Governance for various uses, for example:\n   * Future contributor incentives\n   * Liquidity mining programs\n   * Staking rewards\n   * Protocol mergers & talent acquisitions\n   * Cross-protocol incentives to tighten co-operation across the ecosystem family of projects\n\nThis **benefits Yearn** as a whole by:\n\n- Retaining existing contributors\n- Incentivizing new contributors\n- Capitalizing the Treasury to a scale comparable to industry peers in order to better support growth\n\n\nThis **benefits YFI holders** in particular by:\n\n- Creating a strategic reserve to advance Yearn as one of the world's leading DeFi protocols\n- Aligning incentives across stakeholders\n- Providing for Yearn's future\n\n# Motivation\n\n## Evolve the fair launch \n- Yearn's launch was exceptional at creating a decentralized and engaged community, but it did not provide adequate incentives to retain existing and future contributors on an ongoing basis, nor did it provide the protocol with a war chest to fund future activities.\n- Viewing the fair launch as a living concept rather than a single event, this proposal seeks to remedy this\n- It does so with an emphasis on funding the Treasury for the benefit of all active protocol participants over the existing contributors at a ratio of rougly 2:1 in terms of allocated YFI\n\n## Remove Yearn's Competitive Disadvantage\n\n_Excerpt from  [[1]](#References):_\n\n>**Team token allocations**\n>Projects such as Uniswap, Aave, Synthetix, Compound, 1inch, Curve, and Balancer hold anywhere from $300 million-$2.13 billion in tokens aside for [contributors], with the average being between $500-600 million. This is generally 20-30% of the total token allocation. Newer projects such as SushiSwap, Badger, CREAM, Harvest, and Cover vary more between teams, but allocate between 10-25% of token supply to their teams and early contributors.\n>\n>**Treasury\/operations token allocations**\nWhile the numbers vary here more widely, most of the major projects still have significant token amounts set aside for operations. Uniswap is on the high end with $4 billion, Aave, Synthetix, Balancer, and 1inch all have between $200-$570 million, and likely other projects without any tokens set aside for operations have ample funding from investors (Curve and Compound).\n\n## Why mint?\n\n_Excerpt from  [[2]](#References):_\n\n> [The decision] comes down to the market for talent and the opportunity cost for YFI contributors. We looked at other successful DeFi projects to see what the market says top-tier talent is worth:\n> \n> ![](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/business20\/uploads\/yearn\/original\/2X\/8\/89eba70dade40032f422b719f59e7a6aa7318e87.png)\n>\n> The UNI team has 21.3% of tokens (which includes tokens for future employees) and UNI holders collectively control a treasury with 43% of the supply. At current market prices of $9.2 (which reflects a fully diluted valuation of $9.2B), each bucket has several billion dollars worth of UNI \u2013 team ~$2B and treasury ~$4B \u2013 giving the Uniswap team significant fire power for hiring and enabling a lot of future growth spend from the treasury (both buckets are subject to 4-year vesting).\n>\n> The COMP team has 26% of tokens and a smaller but still significant treasury with 7.8%. At the current market price of $226 per COMP, the team allocation is ~$580M and treasury ~$176M.\n>\n> You can quickly see that a treasury of $500K and a team allocation of 0% is way off market. The reality is that for Yearn to allocate even 5% (which would be well below the examples above), at current market prices (~$37K) Yearn would need to either earn $56M or mint $56M worth of YFI. **Given that a conservative figure is presently an order of magnitude higher than annualized YFI holder income, the only reasonable way to bridge the gap in the near-term is through a mint.**\n\n## Why 6,666 YFI?\n- 6,666 is 22% of the current total supply of 30,000 YFI.\n- After gathering feedback, modeling a number of mint scenarios and various retention package estimates, a ~20% increase was determined to be the minimum viable amount to provide competitive retention plan, using only roughly 1\/3 of the total mint amount.\n- 22% is in line with yearn's peers, for example Aave minted 23% when they migrated from LEND to AAVE.[[3]](#References)\n\n## Improve Talent Retention & Acquisition\n- Contributors have recently been poached by other projects.\n- With the current operational treasury size of $500,000 and 0% token allocation to the team, Yearn struggles to compete with the compensation packages offered in the current market. These are becoming increasingly competitive.\n\n### BABY is a great first step, but not enough on its own\n\nBuyback and Build Yearn (BABY)[[4]](#References) establishes a moving target for YFI buybacks in USD terms. As Yearn earns more revenue in USD terms, it's possible that the YFI price in USD adjusts upwards to reflect those increased earnings. So it would be like trying to catch your own tail. Modeling shows that using 50% of Treasury earnings for buybacks would purchase 100-300 YFI per year (see sensitivities below). Even with the assumption that V2 vaults end up being very successful, earnings will likely not be enough to accumulate a sufficient amount of YFI for the Treasury.\n\nBelow are two different BABY scenarios. One sensitizing aggregate yields on V2 vaults and their effect on YFI buybacks. The other sensitizing operating expenses and their effect on YFI buybacks. The other with 100% of net income.\n\n***Aggregate Yields Sensitivity***\n![](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/business20\/uploads\/yearn\/original\/2X\/d\/d149d69defb3b49e408457051857a78ce1b12242.png)\n![](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/business20\/uploads\/yearn\/original\/2X\/7\/7c5ab77cc1dbfd2eebd1c8f3cfa3b791214a5501.png)\n\n***Operating Expenses Sensitivity***\n![](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/business20\/uploads\/yearn\/original\/2X\/f\/f8d4da11b2a8c5101629c93c4002e33a2b64f59e.png)\n![](https:\/\/aws1.discourse-cdn.com\/business20\/uploads\/yearn\/original\/2X\/5\/5f190f5e42701ce5f325a6dc875290dd4b1a275c.png)\n\n# Specification\n\n## 1. Mint 6666 YFI\n\nA proof of concept for minting has been produced [[11]](#References). If accepted, Yearn Governance would need to do these things:\n1. Deploy the vesting contract\n2. Call `TimelockGovernance.setTargetGovernance(YearnPact)`\n3. Wait 3 days\n4. Call `TimelockGovernance.updateTargetGovernance()`\n5. Call `YearnPact.brrr()`, which will mint and then revert the YFI token governance back to `TimelockGovernance` immediately thereafter\n\n## 2. Allocate ~1\/3rd to vested retention packages\n\n- Out of the 6,666 minted YFI, allocate roughly 1\/3rd (5% margin on either side) to retention packages in order to provide the sufficient face melt required for effective contributor stickiness.\n- **All YFI allocated to retention packages will be subject to vesting.**\n- Retention package details, including eligibility, amounts, and overall terms, will be prepared and presented by a _Compensation Working Group:_\n   - Working group members are recommended by the Operations team and should include a variety of project contributors.\n   - The Multi-sig approves the proposed members of the working group.\n   - The working group can gather feedback and input from existing community groups or form new ones as required.\n- Once appointed, the working group's tasks will be to:\n    1. Finalize compensation packages\n    2. Finalize vesting terms\n    3. Identify eligible recipients\n    4.

Use bought back YFI for contributor rewards and other Yearn initiatives. Retire the YFI governance vault as it no longer has a use, opening up for it to be replaced in the future with a regular vault. Make it possible to participate in Governance even if one's YFI is being used elsewhere.\n\n## Abstract\n\n**If adopted**, this proposal seeks to:\n1. Replace YFI staking rewards with YFI buybacks, until further notice.\n2. Enable YFI that's actively being used in ways that bring benefit to Yearn to participate in Governance.\n3. Retire the YFI governance vault (yGov). \n\nThis **benefits Yearn** as a whole by:\n* Simplifying Treasury design and operation.\n* Simplifying YFI token mechanics to equally align interests across Yearn stakeholders. \n* Builds up a treasury of YFI that can be deployed through Governance for various uses.\n\nThis **benefits YFI holders** in particular by:\n* Removing the need to stake YFI to enjoy rewards; in contrast to staking (which only benefits stakers), buybacks should benefit every YFI holder.\n* Potentially making gains more tax efficient as capital appreciation through buybacks could be taxed less than dividend income through staking rewards.\n* Allowing participation in YFI Governance even whilst the YFI tokens are utilized elsewhere, for example providing liquidity in SushiSwap.\n\n## Motivation \n\n### Previous proposals\n\nThis proposal comes on the back of previously made proposals and YIPs: \n* The adoption of YIP-54[[1]](#References) formalized an Operations Fund and allowed for discretionary YFI buybacks.\n* @RyanWatkins proposed a rethink of Yearn\u2019s capital allocation strategy.[[2]](#References) Arguing for protocol rewards to be used to buy back YFI rather than to reward YFI stakers, distributing protocol income as dividends would be a suboptimal capital allocation strategy given Yearn\u2019s stage of maturity. Instead, the proposal claimed it would be more optimal to use income to drive growth and asset appreciation instead.\n* @dudesahn called for the existing Governance vault and strategy to be replaced with more conventional investment strategy.[[3]](#References) Utilizing MakerDAO to mint DAI, this would be used for liquidity mining. One part of the returns would be rewarded to stakers, and the other would be used to fund Yearn's Bug Bounty program and yAcademy.\n* Joel Monegro (Placeholder VC) recently published the essay \u201cStop Burning Tokens \u2013 Buyback And Make Instead\u201d[[4]](#References) where he suggested that protocols should buy back and reissue tokens to incentivize growth rather than buying back and burning tokens to return value to token holders. This buyback strategy could be especially well suited for Yearn as the YFI supply is capped at 30,000, meaning that the initial conditions for Yearn\u2019s wealth distribution have been set, and no YFI can be further issued to incentivize growth. Such a \u201cBuyback and Make\u201d strategy could allow Yearn to receive the benefits of YFI inflation without any inflation.\n\n### Rationale\n\n![ryan-fees-earned](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/4562643\/104811569-90ace080-580d-11eb-9d1f-6ee5b7a09dd6.png)\n\n_Figure 1. Staking rewards earned over time (USD).[[5]](#References)_\n\n#### Replace staking rewards with buybacks\n* **More suitable at this stage in the lifecycle.** It is unconventional to pay out returns in the form of staking rewards this early in a project's lifecycle. Typically this would happen at a stage where funds no longer can be allocated efficiently.\n* **Better aligns with YFI's use case.** YFI is primarily intended to be used for the governance of Yearn. Token mechanics should cater to those who take interest in the protocol and wish to actively participate in its improvement, over those looking to passively collect staking income.\n* **Potentially more tax-efficient for YFI holders.** The gains on YFI staking may be treated as ordinary income. In contrast, a buyback program enables growth in YFI while YFI holders should only be taxed on a capital gains basis for a sale. Results may vary by jurisdiction and this does not constitute tax advice; consult your own tax advisor. \n* **Recycles YFI that can be spent through Governance.** The resulting accumulation of YFI in the Treasury could enable future governance proposals on the use of this YFI for the further benefit of Yearn.\n\n#### Widen YFI accepted for Governance voting\n* **Acknowledge more uses of YFI for the benefit of Yearn.** There are other ways than holding YFI in your wallet that can benefit Yearn, for example by providing liquity to a YFI pair on SushiSwap. These YFI are not allowed to vote in Governance today, but they should be.\n* **Remove capital efficiency and governance trade-offs.** Similarly, there shouldn't need to be a trade-off between participating in Governance or utilizing YFI efficiently.\n\n#### Retire the yGov vault\n* **Vault no longer needed.** Without staking rewards, there is no need for a yGov staking vault that's tied to Governance.\n* **Staking returns are aenemic.** At the time of this writing, the APY estimate is 0.9% annually [[6]](#References). This is not competitive, and may even dissuade YFI holders from participating in governance. In comparison, Binance recently announced up to 4.49% APY for staking YFI.[[7]](#References).\n\n### Future possibilities\n* Introduce contributor retention program, with vesting YFI rewards to create long term skin-in-the-game for existing and new contributors.\n* Re-introduce dividends once Yearn has matured and protocol income no longer can be re-invested as efficiently into growth.\n* Introduce a conventional vault for YFI, using the v2 vault design. Such a vault would not be related to governance or staking rewards, and would be free to pursue other, to-be-determined strategies.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Replace staking rewards with buybacks\n\n#### Buy back YFI\n* All funds that are used for YFI staking rewards are to be used to buy back YFI. Staking rewards cease until further governance action.\n* Buybacks should be handled in a continuous and automated way, and not be discretionary or requiring any sign-offs.\n* Care should be taken to avoid creating arbitrage or front-running opportunities. Detailed specification of design is left to the developers implementing.\n\n#### Use of bought YFI\n* There are no changes in how funds are spent.\n* The YFI bought back flows into the Operations Fund established by YIP-54 and can be spent accordingly.\n* Example of current spends include: Security audits, Bug bounties, Contributor funding, Grants, Gas reimbursment, Development overhead. See the recently published quarterly financial report[[8]](#References) for a detailed breakdown.\n\n### Widen YFI accepted for Governance voting\n* Link snapshot to use guest-list[[9]](#References) to determine which YFI is eligible for voting.\n* This functionality is already supported and excludes protocols such as Aave which could be utilized in governance attacks. The list of supported protocols is configurable and is being reviewed continuously, improvements and suggestions can be submitted to the repo.\n* Any YFI in the Yearn Treasury \/ Operations Fund is not eligible to vote.\n\n### Retire YFI Governance vault\n* Retire the ygov.finance[[10]](#References) staking vault and the YFI yVault YFIGovernance strategy that relies on it.\n\n## Changelog\n- Jan 13: Clarified voting specification to explicitly state that YFI in the treasury cannot be used to vote.

Future changes can be made through additional YIPs.\n- Together with the previously approved YIP-51 and YIP-52, this is the final piece in a trilogy of YIPs seeking to upgrade Yearn operations and financials. \n\n## Background\n\nAs Yearn evolves, so does the need to cover operational expenses and quickly react to changes.\n\nYIP-36[[1]](#References) laid the groundwork for Yearn operations funding. YIP-41[[2]](#References) extended this with the inclusion of a one-off operations budget. A forum thread envisioned the Multisig acting as an \"operations special interest group\"[[3]](#References). Today, there are multiple special interest groups (such as development, documentation, governance, branding\/design, and communications) that are not directly related to the Multisig, but partly financed through the YIP-41 budget. The Multisig acts as an executor of the spending decisions of these groups. \n\nThis YIP builds on the previously adopted proposals to formalize a structure for sustainable funding of operations, to further Yearn's development and growth.\n\n### Out of scope\nThe following questions are not covered:\n- **How should YFI staking rewards be spent?** Proposals such as [[4]](#References) argue for a change in how staking rewards should be spent. This should be decided on separately by YFI voters. \n- **How should spending decisions be made?** This proposal focuses on the funding of operations activities, and how these are reported transparently. Decision-making processes are assumed to be existing per YIP-41.\n- **What is Yearn's long term governance structure?** YIP-41 temporarily empowers the Multisig while preparations are made for \"a more robust governance architecture\". Any material change to Yearn's governance would also need to consider the management of the Operations Fund.\n\n### In scope\nThe proposal attempts to answer the following questions:\n- **How do we sustainably fund operations over the longer term?** The budget in YIP-41 is one-off, for six months only. How do we ensure that operations activities are funded on an ongoing basis? \n- **How do we reward contributors better?** Today, contributors are paid in yUSD. There's a desire to partially reward contributors in YFI as well, to give them skin in the game and a stake in the success of Yearn. With a fixed supply of YFI, there needs to be a way to acquire YFI to be used as such.\n- **How do we keep accountability, without adding unnecessary overhead?** While we want sustainable funding and contributors to be empowered to act quickly and decisively, we also need to scrutinize spending decisions and hold those who make them accountable. Ideally this should be a\u00a0simple process that avoids slowing down progress.  \n\n### Examples of Operations Expenditure\n* **Security costs.** 3rd party audits, bug bounties, tools.\n* **Contributor funding.** Recurring payments for full time contributors, one-off grants, bounties.\n* **Third party products & services.** Freelancers, companies. \n* **Running costs.** Gas expenditure, tools, equipment, infrastructure.\n\n#### Current Yearn operations spend\nEstimated to total ~$434,000 as of November 10, 2020. More than half of the operations spend is security related, with the greater part of the remainder spent on funding contributors in various forms.\n\n![](https:\/\/svgshare.com\/i\/RNu.svg)\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Justifying the proposal\n\n#### 1. Sizing the Operations Fund \nThe budget set in YIP-41 has so far been sufficient; there is no desire to increase it. Rather, the purpose is to transition from a one-off budget to a continuous funding process. \n\n##### Approximating current allocation\n\n![|3200x1440, 20%](https:\/\/svgshare.com\/i\/RPN.svg)\n\nThe above diagram is based on data of the total fees collected by Yearn vaults in a four month period, from July 30 - Nov 05 2020.[[5]](#References)\n\nThe fees have then been allocated according to the new vault fee structure of YIP-51[[6]](#References) and the updated Strategist allocation of YIP-52[[7]](#References).\n\nThe current budget for operations is based off of the allocation in YIP-41[[2]](#References), calculated as:\n```\n(a) $ 500,000 + (b) 4 * $ 181,000 = $ 1,224,000 \n```\nWhere `(a)` is the bug bounty allocation, and `(b)` is four months worth of monthly operations expenses.\n\nThis gives an **approximation** of how rewards would be\u00a0allocated today, based on YIP-41, -51, and -52. Roughly **53% of the treasury funds** would be allocated to Operations.\n\n##### Proposed allocation\n\nBased on this, the proposal is to round this number down to an **even 50%** and divide the Treasury funds equally between YFI staking rewards and Operations:\n\n![|3200x1440, 20%](https:\/\/svgshare.com\/i\/RPG.svg)\n\n#### 2. Rewarding contributors\n\nPaying a proportion of grants in YFI is an obvious and immediate way to give contributors a stake in the success of Yearn.\n\nAs the Treasury does not earn YFI, nor is it able to mint YFI, the straightforward way to acquire YFI is to **buy back YFI** with part of the Operations Fund. \n\nAlthough this could incidentally have the added benefit of increasing buy demand for YFI, the purpose would not be to manipulate YFI price or to engineer long-term YFI price appreciation. Rather, the purpose would be to add YFI to the Operations Fund in order to reward contributors through YFI grants.\n\nRather than making an explicit pledge, or revealing a process that then is at risk of being exploited, it thought to be better to trial this on an ad-hoc basis. Exact capital allocations would be determined at the discretion of the Multisig based on various factors, including prevailing market conditions.\n\nFor instance, the recent negative downturn of the YFI price would have made an excellent buy opportunity for the Operations Fund.\n\nAs new Yearn products are introduced, so could the need emerge to buy back other assets than YFI. The Operations Fund therefore should have  the right to buy any asset as required.\n\n#### 3. Keeping contributors accountable\n\nAs operations move to continuous funding, tracking spending decisions and holding contributors accountable becomes ever more important.\n\nThis proposal does not introduce any new spending mechanisms. All spending is signed off by the Multisig, with activities already tracked and published in a dedicated repo, `\/ychad-audit`[[8]](#References).\n\nIn addition, a quarterly Operations Fund Report will be published documenting the activities of the previous period, how funds were spent, the current health of the Operations Fund, and what the focus for the upcoming quarter will be. The report helps YFI holders to audit the fund, and intervene as required by passing a YIP with new fund guidelines.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIn addition to the above 50-50 split, the following alternative spending allocations were considered:\n\n* **Allocating 100% of the management fee to the Operations Fund.** This would mean that 100% of the performance fee share would go to YFI stakers. This proposal would have meant a slightly larger Operations Fund, with income that would have been more predictable, as it would not be determined by actual vault performance but by total funds locked in Yearn. \n* **Allocating 75% of the management fee to Operations, and 25% of the performance fee.** Similarly, this would add a bit of performance fee into the mix, but keep the majority of the funds assigned to Operations coming from the amount of capital held in the vaults.\n\nWhile stability and predictability for the Operations Fund is desired, it is more important for contributors to have an equal amount of skin in the game as YFI stakers, even if this leads to a smaller budget if vaults underperform.  \n\n### Future possibilities\n* **Long-term YFI vesting, or yVest.** An obvious next step would be to establish some form of vesting plan for YFI allocation for long-term contributors. This could be realized with a contributor vault that \"dog foods\" strategies.\n* **Team Funds.** As teams mature, they could be allocated dedicated budgets from the Operations Fund, increasing decentralization and autonomy.\n* **Financial planning and analysis.** As Operations continues to evolve, further planning, budgeting, and forecasting can be added when deemed necessary.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Effective with the introduction of Vaults v2, allocate 50% of Treasury fees to an Operations Fund, with the other 50% distributed to YFI stakers.\n2. Permit the Operations Fund to buy YFI or any other asset as required with its funds, and to include such in the assets at its disposal.\n3. Produce quarterly financial reports of the Operations Fund activities and decisions.\n4. As it goes in effect, the Operations Fund replaces the treasury cap of YIP-36 and the budget of YIP-41.\n5. The Operations Fund, its asset purchase authorization, and the other matters contemplated herein are not permanent, and can be altered or replaced by YFI holders as required, through the passing of a new YIP.\n\n## Vote\n\n**For:** Yes, establish the Operations Fund.\n\n**Against:** No, reject the proposal.\n\n**Note:** 3-days voting poll is **binding** (live from Nov 12 - Nov 15).\n\n## References\n\n1. https:\/\/yips.yearn.finance\/YIPS\/yip-36\n2. https:\/\/yips.yearn.finance\/YIPS\/yip-41\n3. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/understanding-decentralization-prioritizing-an-operations-team\/\n4. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/proposal-rethinking-capital-allocation\/\n5.

Mission: audit Yearn contracts in a collaborative and semi-structured process. Administrative costs are kept near zero, as the tasks of advocacy, event organizing, educational curriculum are handled by our partners at Gitcoin and Status. The yAcademy is net positive from day one since money that would have otherwise been an operational expense given to auditing firms is now an investment that should pay back the principle immediately (in the form of audits of Yearn contracts) and generate revenue eventually (once the team has expanded to offer services to the ecosystem). \n\nTo align incentives, equity shares in the yAcademy is distributed to YFI governors, yAcademy partners, and the first five auditors to join. The alignment can be seen in the following figure:\n\n![final|690x408](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/4562643\/98841510-41d37b00-2459-11eb-95a7-705f40020e35.png) \n\n## Glossary of terms:\n**_Stakeholders_**: YFI holders, Gitcoin, Status, yAcademy permanent members (auditors)\n**_Founding members_**: the first five auditors to join the yAcademy. They get equity in yAcademy.\n**_Mentees_**: outstanding participants in the KERNEL program that compele the curriculum and show promise, they are invited to shadow audit in yAcademy in close collaboration with Founding Members and Yearn core team.\n\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe Yearn technical community is innovating at a rapid speed. Efforts must be made to mitigate software bugs. Auditing talent is currently scarce and will continue to be for sometime because the pace of innovation in smart-contract products is much faster than that of producing auditors.\n\nThe Yearn community already expends a significant amount of time negotiating audit contracts or coordinating one-off informal audits. Planting the seed for an auditing wing of Yearn will bring immense benefits in the short and long term. Money spent on audits is a realized cost, while money spent on yAcademy is an investment. Yearn has thus far this year spent more on audits\/bounties more than the projected budget for yAcademy. By keeping administrative costs near zero, the yAcademy should be a net positive to YFI holders from day one. If structured and run efficiently, we should witness the rise of a new breed of excellent auditors that get vetted by going through the KERNEL program run by our partners at Gitcoin and Status.\n\nThe Yearn community should incentivise rising stars to stay and continue to work on Yearn contracts full time. As Yearn matures over-time, yAcademy can begin to offer services to the outside world. At that point, the yAcademy becomes a self-sufficient, and potentially massively profitable. To align incentives, equity in the yAcademy is distributed to YFI holders (65%), Gitcoin (10%), Status, and the first five permanent auditors (5%, 4%, 3%, 1.5%, 1.5% to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th members respectively).\n\n## Motivation\n\n-  Yearn is innovating at an ever increasing speed.\n\n-  Software bugs are a matter of \"when\" and \"how bad\", not \"if\". We must make mitigation efforts.\n\n-  Auditing firms are overbooked, they have financial incentive to speed up audits which can affect quality.\n\n-  Negotiating audit contracts with auditing firms is a laborious and clunky analog process. \n\n-  Audit contracts are very expensive.\n\n-  Yearn is a hub of innovation and as a result should attract top talent.\n\n-  Smart contracts will probably experience an even bigger cambrian explosion once the enterprise starts using permissionless networks such as Ethereum as a settlement layer. Hence, the yAdademy will most likely become an highly-profitable organization, thereby paying back all the investment put into it .. and then some.\n\n- YFI are better off having auditing expenditure be an investment that pays itself back and more, rather than a realized operational cost lost to auditing firms.\n\n- Yearn has spent on security audits\/bounties this year more than the projected budget for Yearn. \n\n## Specification\n\nThe figure above summarizes the flow, responsibilities, and expectations. \n\n### Overview \n\n- The academy is governed by all of its stakeholders but not micro-managed. The day to day by the auditors themselves autonomously, in close collaboration with the core team, and supervision of the multisig holders. YFI governors, Gitcoin, and Status may get involved if major decisions are to be made.\n\n- Start with 1 founding auditor, with the expectation to add 1-2 more at the end of each KERNEL-Curriculum-Shadowing iteration depicted in the figure above (2-4 iterations per year).\n\n- Communication between auditors and mentees is kept as efficient as possible. No endless tm discussions, but rather a streamlined lines of communication using productivity software.\n\n- Being a mentee in the yAcademy is trial-by-fire type of situation: mentees walk along the process of auditing a contract, receiving hints and\/or assignments, results are shared in a certain format ect.\n\n- Mentees join by invitation only, and are unpaid. A few select mentees are selected based from the cohort of ~100 participants in the KERNEL program, but may be invited from the outside as founding editors, core team, and the community at large see fit.\n\n- Mentees that show merit begin to receive rewards. If they continue shining, they may be extended an offer to become permanent members with competitive compensation and equity (equity to the first 5 founding members only).\n\n- Yearn gets a 65% equity in the yAcademy in return for bootstrapping funding, sponsorship of KERNELs, and rewards to outstanding shadow auditors. The Yearn core team will be instrumental in the early stages of yAcademy to bring auditors up to speed and share their expertise. The remaining equity goes 10% to Gitcoin, 10% to Status, and 15% to the first five founding members: 5%, 4%, 3%, 1.5%, and 1.5% to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th founding members, respectively. \n\n\n### Rationale:\n\n-  Traditional ways of education and collaboration are obsolete.\n\n-  Invitation-only is an efficiency measure, to make sure time and energy is not wasted hand-holding mentees. But anyone who shows interest and meets the basic minimal requirements should get an invitation.\n\n-  Merit-based: auditors that stick around and bring value are rewarded.\n\n-  Synchronous communication is inefficient. \n\n-  Some structure in the collaboration between mentors and mentees is needed to reduce time waste.\n\n-  No time is wasted authoring educational materials: this is a trial-by-fire type of situation, mentees learn by walking along the auditing process of **real** contracts.\n\n- Equity ensures incentive alignments and reduces bootstrapping operational costs to the absolute minimum. By granting equity to founding members, yAcademy can stay competitive with the industry standard while not allocating too much money on salaries. At the same time, auditors are incentived to perform well since yAcademy's growth means the growth of their equity's value.\n\n### Short-term operational outlook (1-2 years):\n\nYFI governers should expect a budget of ~150-200k in the first year covering the funding of 1-2 founding members and including mentee rewards and kernel sponsorship. The second year's budget will be decided when the time comes, but is expected to not exceed the first year's significantly because the founding members may by then have reached a level where they can take on outside contracts for a premium, which then goes back to funding the yAcademy itself.\n\nyAcademy may go through iterations as we learn and adjust during the first 1-2 years. Current stakeholders all have a track record of being good actor in the ecosystem, and so the happy case outlined in the figure above has a good chance of squeezing out incredible value for the stakeholders and the ecosystem as a whole. \n\n# vote\n\n**Yes**: launch the yAcademy, allocate the budget, hire the first member, and start scouting for the second after the first KERNEL event Jan-Mar 2020.\n\n**No**: do not launch yAcademy, keep the status quo of Yearn paying auditing firms and\/or having the core team take on security and\/or rely on white hackers to find bugs for bounties.","protocol":"ybaby","adapter":"archive","proposer":"0x7A1057E6e9093DA9C1D4C1D049609B6889fC4c67","totalVotes":141,"blockNumber":11237558,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yearn\/proposal\/QmPTAfJCq3UtFZqY3jdgNEJsxc6yuHwfESnQyjjkoccZrJ","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1605114000}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1605373200}","startTimestamp":1605114000,"endTimestamp":1605373200,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Launch yAcademy', 'Do not launch yAcademy']","results":"[{'total': 937.08716, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 0.0992, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This could turn into an **existential threat** to the protocol.\n-   This proposal sets Yearn and Strategists out to be **equal partners** in the success of a Vault, with each allocated an even share of the 20% performance fee:\n    - Treasury allocation: 10%\n    - Strategist: 10%\n\n\n## Background\n\n### What is Yearn's competitive edge?\n\n#### Yearn as an aggregator\nYearn is often referred to as a \"Yield aggregator\", in the context of Ben Thompson's Aggregation Theory[[1]](#References). \n\n![Aggregation Theory](https:\/\/stratechery.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/07\/Screen-Shot-2018-03-27-at-12.47.09-PM.png)\n\nSimilar to Google for search, Facebook for social, Netflix for movies, Airbnb for holiday rentals, and Uber for rides, the idea is that Yearn should be the go-to source for users who want to earn the best and most predictable ROI on their DeFi investments.\n\nUnlike these big tech companies however, there are some important differences in the case of Yearn as an aggregator:\n\n* **The code base is open source.** If Yearn solves a hard problem, this means that others can now solve it too. The code base itself is not the competitive moat that it is for other aggregators. As we've seen it's straightforward to create forks\/clones and launch competitors to Yearn.\n* **There is no stickiness.** Aggregators have different degrees of stickiness. The Facebook Social Graph is extremely hard to replicate and makes it very difficult for users to switch to a competitor. While it's easy to switch to a Netflix competitor, they will miss out on exclusive original Netflix content so it comes at a cost. Uber's driver pool and Airbnb's housing stock is less unique and easier for its competitors to bootstrap or poach, but is still not trivial to replicate. Yearn on the other hand has no systemic stickiness. It does not even require canceling a subscription, or closing of an account. In the DeFi space, money flows to where it earns the best and most predictable returns. \n* **What's on offer is ever changing and not  easily commoditized.** The aggregators turn \"the hardest problem digitized\" into a commodity. For Facebook it is news articles and social content. For Netflix it's movies and tv-shows. In the case of Yearn, this would be yield-producing investment strategies. _But these cannot be easily commoditized:_ \n   * As soon as a strategy goes live, it can be replicated by competitors, thus affecting its performance.\n   * As more capital flows into the strategy, it can become harder to realize the same opportunities, thus affecting its performance.\n   * As time passes, a successful strategy will lose its alpha as the rest of the market adapts in response, thus affecting its performance.\n\n#### Yearn's Gingerbread Man strategy\n\nWhen Snap filed to go public, they wrote in their S-1 filing:\n\n> In a world where anyone can distribute products instantly and provide them for free, the best way to compete is by innovating to create the most engaging products. That\u2019s because it\u2019s difficult to use distribution or cost as a competitive advantage\u2014new software is available to users immediately, and for free. We believe this means that our industry favors companies that innovate, because people will use their products.\n\nThis triggered the same Ben Thompson to quip that Snap was pursuing a Gingerbread Man strategy[[2]](#References):\n\n> Run, run, run as fast as you can.\nYou\u2019ll never catch me, I\u2019m the gingerbread man.\n\nThis applies well\u00a0to describe Yearn and the  advantage it has over its competition. It's not the total value locked. It's not the APY returns. It's the ability to ship more innovating products, that are more secure and better performant than anything else on the market. This at a faster pace than the competition can keep up with and try to imitate.\n\n#### Yearn's edge is the collective brain power it attracts and can retain building for it\n\nIf Yearn's business is aggregating yield-bearing strategies, its Strategy creators are the equivalent of Uber's drivers. **Strategy creators are however very different from Uber drivers.** They have much more unique skill sets, making them harder to replace, and more important to retain.\n\n### A Strategist's choices\nSomeone who develops an investment strategy that results in a positive yield has the following choices today: \n\n1. **Work for Yearn.** Partner up, work with protocol devs to integrate Strategy in a vault, hope for launch with a large influx of capital, be compensated as part of the performance.\n2. **Create competing project or work for a competitor.** Either launch a competing project to Yearn, or work for an existing competitor, in the hopes of earning more fees.\n3. **One man wolf pack it.** Deploy strategy solo, perhaps raising funds from friends and family, and keep all the fees.\n\nIn order for Yearn to remain competitive over the long term, the best and the brightest strategists must consistently choose to work with Yearn. This an existential question, necessary in order to ensure the long term sustainability of the protocol.\n\n### How are strategists rewarded today?\nThe next version of Yearn vaults will launch with a two-pronged fee structure[[3]](#References):\n   1. A 2% management fee levied on AUM that goes to the Treasury;\n   2. A 20% performance fee levied on returns from the vault, which is split as follows:\n      * 19.5% to the Treasury\n      * **0.5% to the Strategy creator**\n\nStrategists are expected to cover their own development, testing, gas, and monitoring costs. Under the current allocation, Strategists are not breaking even at times.[[4]]() \n\n## Motivation\n\n### Why not share the management fee?\n* **The protocol requires predictable income.** There are a lot of constant costs on the protocol side. Operations, Development, maintenance, and R&D. These require a stable source of funding and should not be affected by Strategists.\n* **Survival of the fittest.** Strategists should \"eat what they kill\", rewarding only the most ambitious and best performing, filtering out the rest. \n\n### Why split the fee equally between Treasury and Strategists?\n\n* **Establishes a partnership.** The message is clear: Yearn and Strategists are in this together, and it's a symbiotic relationship, where both are held accountable and are equally responsible for success.\n* **Acquisition.** Creates success stories of high earning Strategists that will make it more aspirational and attractive for others to become Strategists.  \n* **Retention.** Strategists with a lot of skin in the game will work and further Yearn as opposed to  a competitor.\n\n### Future possibilities\n\n**Tiered fee system.** As the Strategy creation space matures, there could be justification to distinguish between different qualities of strategies, creating a tiered system that rewards a different share of the performance fee based on the novelty and the sophistication of the strategy, as  proposed in [[5]](#References). At this stage, it's recommended to keep a simple structure that is easy to reason about and for Strategists to understand the appeal of. This should be revisited in the future when needed. \n\n### Comparing allocations\nDrawing from the backtesting data produced in [[6]](#References), below is the Vaults V2 fee model applied to the yUSD vault, showing the difference in earnings between Strategists and Yearn treasury between allocation models.\n\n#### Previous allocation\n![Previous model sankey](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/YdnDHmV\/sankeymatic-2400x1400.png)\n\n#### Proposed allocation\n\n![Previous model sankey](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/9pNCTqw\/sankeymatic-2400x1400-2.png)\n\n#### Comments\n\n* The previous allocation to Strategists is disproportionately small compared to the value created by them.\n* In the proposed allocation, the **Yearn treasury receives 64% of all fees** as it is paid the entirety of the management fee.\n* The Strategist now earns a sizable reward that is entirely based on performance. \n\n## Specification\n\n### New performance fee structure\n\n-   20% performance fee\n    -   10% allocated to Treasury\n    -   10% allocated to the Strategist\n\nThe Strategist is expected to pay for all expenses incurred, including those of development, testing, gas, monitoring, and operation.\n\n## References\n\n1. https:\/\/stratechery.com\/concept\/aggregation-theory\/\n2. https:\/\/stratechery.com\/2017\/snaps-apple-strategy\/ \n3. https:\/\/snapshot.page\/#\/yearn\/proposal\/QmSaYHR97LDMDvg9xeTfdNZw6aqL9njxBKM6JVFtCYxKvB\n4. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/proposal-increase-strategist-rewards\/7299\/8\n5. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/proposal-increase-strategist-rewards\/7299\/10\n6. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/restructure-fees-and-align-incentives\/\n","protocol":"ybaby","adapter":"archive","proposer":"0x0Cec743b8CE4Ef8802cAc0e5df18a180ed8402A7","totalVotes":222,"blockNumber":11224799,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yearn\/proposal\/QmbAq6jPB6ocrihjkDo5TLNF4D4w9dw1HsEsJ7vwdwd9g3","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1604945400}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1605162000}","startTimestamp":1604945400,"endTimestamp":1605162000,"currentState":"closed","choices":"[' Accept proposal', 'Reject proposal']","results":"[{'total': 1341.9396, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 260.1291, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

No withdrawal fee\n    2. Management fee (2%)\n    3. Performance fee (20%)\n-   The proposal leaves:\n    -   Total fees collected at roughly the same level as for Vaults v1\n    -   Strategist reward allocation unchanged\n    -   YFI staking and rewards unchanged\n    -   Treasury management unchanged\n\n## Background\n\nThe high level design of the next iteration of Yearn Vaults, v2, has been voted on and approved by YFI holders.[[1]](#References) It is currently in the later stages of the development cycle. Testing has begun, and security audits are in progress.\n\nWith the new vaults likely being weeks away from launch, it is high time to finalize how fees will be collected in them.\n\n### Out of scope\n\nThere are currently active discussions underway in the community about many related topics, such as to what extent:\n\n-    Rewards should be distributed to YFI stakers [[2]](#References)\n-   Strategist creators should be rewarded  for their contributions [[3]](#References)\n-   Contributors should be allocated a portion of rewards for the purpose of long term incentivization [[4]](#References)\n\nThose questions are not answered by this proposal, and are not discussed further here. Specifically, anything that concerns what fees are spent on, how different stakeholders are compensated, or how the treasury should be run, is not covered by this proposal and is assumed to be unchanged.\n\n### In scope\n\nInstead, the focus here is to determine _how fees are collected_, and _the total amount collected_, with the intention to meet the following objectives:\n\n-   **Keep fees at roughly the same level.** The proposal should not lead to a significant change in the overall fee levels that are in place today with Vaults v1.\n-   Ensure fees incentivize the desired behavior among various stakeholders:\n    -   **Users** should be encouraged to keep funds in a vault if it performs well, and withdraw if the vault under-performs.\n    -   **Yearn** should be encouraged to design the best possible vaults, by ensuring rewards go up as a vault attracts and retains capital, and go down as capital leaves the vault. Similarly, rewards should increase if the vault performs well, and decrease if it under-performs.\n    -   **Third party integrations** should be encouraged to integrate Yearn vaults in their own products and services. It should be easy for them to reason about the expected behavior when depositing and withdrawing, and the fees charged by the vault.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Previous fee structure, Vaults v1\n\n-   5% performance fee, out of which\n    -   4.5% went to Treasury\n    -   0.5% went to the Strategist\n-   0 to 0.5% withdrawal fee\n    -   0% when funds were available in the Vault\n    -   0.5% when funds had to be withdrawn from the Strategy\n\n### Problems with a fee on withdrawals\n\n-   **Charges Users when they are the least happy with the vault.** You are charged a withdrawal fee when you no longer use the vault. If the vault performs, you would leave your funds in it and avoid paying for the service.\n-   **Rewards Yearn when there is capital flight.** More money leaving the vault leads to more fees, when it should be the opposite.\n-   **Can be gamed.** Astute users and integrations can time it so that they make free withdrawals in the period after the vault has seen deposits, as long as it's done before those funds have been sent to the Strategy for investing.\n-   **Makes fees unpredictable for integrations.** It's unclear what the fees charged will be prior to the actual withdrawal, making it harder for third party integrations to calculate ROI accurately.\n\n### Benefits with a management fee\n\n-   **Continuous pay based on usage.** The vault provides a service that people are paying for, continuously, based on the time their capital is in the vault. There is no incentive to withdraw late or early.\n-   **Encourages optimizing for retention.** Yearn earns more fees when users keep funds in the vault, and makes less when they withdraw.\n-   **Benefits composability.** Makes it easier to integrate Vaults with other products and services.\n\n### Comparing fees with v1\n\nThe backtesting data produced in [[4]](#References) shows how the new fee model is delivering roughly the same amount of total fees, compared to the model used in Vaults v1:\n\n![bar chart](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/dI13oYy.png)\n\n|  | Withdrawal fee | Performance fee | Management fee | Total fees | % |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| **Old** | $2,243,078 | $466,822 | N\/A | $2,709,900 | 100% |\n| **New** | N\/A | $1,867,288 | $699,237 | $2,566,525 | 95%\n\n#### Comments\n* The previous withdrawal fee accounted for a whopping **83%** of all fees collected. This is very high for a fee that is unrelated to actual performance of the service.\n* In contrast, the management fee in Vaults v2 would only account for **27%** of total fees.\n* A much larger portion of fees are now made out of the performance fee component, **17%** of total fees in the old model, **73%** in the new model. This means that incentives are better aligned as Yearn earns most of it fees and Users pay most of their fees only if the Vaults are performing well.\n\n## Specification\n\n### New fee structure\n\n-   0% withdrawal fee\n-   2% annualized management\n    -   Full amount allocated to Treasury\n    -   Accrued per block\n    -   Collected on each harvest)\n-   20% performance fee\n    -   19.5% allocated to Treasury\n    -   0.5% allocated to the Strategist (unchanged to v1)\n\n## References\n\n1. https:\/\/yearn.snapshot.page\/#\/yearn\/proposal\/QmRKmXuEMaqY38ccvuZREmi6SfMxyhWQMT3mhJ6Cgfeqq9\n2. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/proposal-rethinking-capital-allocation\/7304\/\n3. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/proposal-increase-strategist-rewards\/\n4. https:\/\/gov.yearn.finance\/t\/restructure-fees-and-align-incentives\/","protocol":"ybaby","adapter":"archive","proposer":"0x7A1057E6e9093DA9C1D4C1D049609B6889fC4c67","totalVotes":259,"blockNumber":11204540,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yearn\/proposal\/QmSaYHR97LDMDvg9xeTfdNZw6aqL9njxBKM6JVFtCYxKvB","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1604707200}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1604966400}","startTimestamp":1604707200,"endTimestamp":1604966400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Release Vaults v2 with the proposed fee structure', 'Release Vaults v2 with some other fee to be defined fee structure']","results":"[{'total': 1771.7279, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 4.5321918, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

This framework should help to better organize our vaults and help with future adoption.\n\n# Details\nIn out current system we have an emission that currently adds incentives to users of our first three vaults for one month. These vaults currently use 100% of the profits to put into our platform via buy and burn and the AMP. Some users may feel that this is a bit jarring as they are used to returns outside of farming. This becomes increasingly a problem when the emission ends and this incentive is not longer around. If we intend to keep users after emission, we need to make sure there are some additional incentives to keep users on the platform.\n\nWhat I propose is that we organize our vaults into 3 different categories that each have their own usage and marketing goal to bring in and sustain users. \n\nAdditionally, I propose that we keep with the gaming theme by using the terms Easy\/Normal\/Hard Mode for each of the types of vaults. Below is the framework that I think can help us prosper as we grow as a community.\n\nBelow I detail out how we intend on breaking these vaults out in the framework as well as how the tokenomics would work for each.\n## Hard Mode Vaults\nAll of the current 3 vaults (DAI\/USDT\/USDC) would be categorized as \"Hard Mode\" vaults. These vaults currently are incentivized by the emission of yfBeta. When the first month ends, these vaults will not provide many users immediate profits to keep them in these vaults. This is why we should implement the next two vaults. This pool is where we should expect the \"All-in\" users to reside.\n\n### Details\n* These vaults are generally low risk - low yield.\n* Vaults will be subsidized with yfBeta emission for 1 month.\n* Profits from these vaults are split between the following 3 areas:\n 47.5% to the AMP.\n 47.5% to Buy and Burn.\n 5% for Gas and Deployment Fees\n* The current 3 stable coin vaults are all a part of this category.\n \n## Normal Mode Vaults\nThese vaults solve the problem of \"What will users do when emission ends?\". We should assign any high-risk and high APY strategies to this category to appeal to the majority of our users. Because these vaults still provide much of the daily profits back to the user, this should be significant enough incentive to keep these users on the platform even after the emission ends. This pool is where we would hope many of the users to remain.\n\n### Details\n* These vaults use a higher-risk higher-reward strategy.\n* Profits from these vaults are split between the AMP and User.\n 47.5% profit back to the user.\n 47.5% profit to the AMP.\n 5% to Gas and Deployment Fees\n* These vaults will likely have an emission schedule but will cause far less inflation than Hard Mode vaults. (1.5k over 1 month instead of 3k)\n\n## Easy Mode Vaults\nThese vaults would hope bring in new or undecided users. By allowing users an option that provides a significant amount of profits to the users, it allows users to test out the platform. The hope is that these users enjoy the platform but see the APY numbers available on the \"Normal\" vaults and convert over. If they migrate, they will end up providing much more to the platform and AMP. This is very similar to how yEarn has both  \"Earn\" and \"Vault\" pools.\n\n### Details\n\n* Risk\/Reward will vary from vault to vault of this type.\n* These vaults will return nearly all profit to the user following the below model\n 1-3% to the AMP\n 91-94% to the User\n** 5% for Gas and Deployment Fees\n* This would bring in new users. The hope is that after seeing the returns, users would convert to the \"Normal\" mode vaults and provide more to the AMP while also earn more in profits.\n# TL;DR\nA vote for Yes* means:\n* We will update the front end to show vaults in 3 \"difficulties\" Easy\/Normal\/Hard\/ \n* All new vaults will be chosen and a \"difficulty\" will be assigned based on the community's decision.\n* These categories will work alongside any and all other proposals. \n\nA vote for No** means:\n* We will leave vaults and their tokenomics as they are.\nSorry if the formatting is not great.

At the time of this writing, any funds in these vaults are earning an approximate yield of 12% annually (12% APY), however, the individuals who have deposited their funds in these vaults do not receive any of this yield. Instead:\n\n**47.5% of the yield goes into the Autonomous Money Pile (AMP)**\n**47.5% of the yield buys YFBETA tokens from Uniswap and burns them forever**\n**5% of the yield is reserved for gas fees**\n\nThis means that there is no personal gain to be had by depositing money in the existing vaults. To create an incentive to deposit funds, there is an \u2018emission period\u2019 of 30 days starting on approximately September 21, where each vault will directly reward depositors a total of 100 YFBETA tokens each day. This leads to a total of 9000 tokens being printed. The amount that each depositor receives can be calculated as:\n\n**Daily YFB Reward = 100 * [Deposit Amount] \/ [Total Value Locked]**\n**Daily USD Reward = [Daily YFB Reward] * YFB_PRICE**\n\nAs of this writing, the APY received through this emission bonus is sitting at approximately 200%. Needless to say, there is a clear incentive to deposit funds in these vaults right now. Unfortunately, this hyperinflation of YFBETA tokens has caused prices to plummet from $1300 per token down to $230 in less than a week.\n\n## Valuing YFBETA Tokens\nFrom the outline above, it would appear that anyone can enter the vaults so long as they are willing to deposit stable coins\u2026and that is correct. There is no requirement or benefit to having YFBETA tokens in any way through the existing vaults. In fact, the only purpose of the tokens is to sell them to the open market to get your profit. A good question to ask might be who is buying YFBETA tokens and what value do they have?\n\nHolding YFBETA tokens represents a partial ownership of the AMP that is growing through the yield generated by the vaults. With a max supply of 30,000 tokens, this essentially means that the absolute minimum value of 1 YFBETA token is:\n\n**YFBETA Price >= [AMP Value] \/ 30,000**\n\nInvestors who believe that the AMP will grow to a significantly large size are buying tokens now while they are cheap, in the hope that they will be worth more in the future. In other words, they are playing a long term game where supply is guaranteed to fall (due to the burn mechanic), however the speed at which the AMP grows and the supply drops is critically dependent on the value locked in vaults. It should be noted that another two emission periods are planned in the near future, where another 9000 YFBETA will enter the market.\n\n# The Problem\nThere are a number of issues here:\n\nDuring the emission period(s), the YFBETA price drops like a rock due to hyper-inflation.\nA falling YFB price is not attractive to new investors when they first hear of the ecosystem.\nOnce the emission period is over, there is no personal gain by continuing to participate in the vaults, since the return will only add to the AMP and reduce supply of YFBETA. If you are not a YFBETA holder, then you would be best placed to move your funds elsewhere.\nPutting all of this together suggests that the future for YFBETA is that hyperinflation will drop the price per token significantly, and once the max supply is reached and there is no more emissions, everyone will exit the vaults and the AMP will not grow. This leaves the AMP very small, and consequently leaves the YFBETA token with very low intrinsic value (AMP \/ 30,000).\n\nThe fundamental issue is that there is no reason to stay in the vaults once emissions finish, and the only reason to hold YFBETA is for long-term faith that one day the AMP will be large AND that you will be able to redeem these tokens for the value stored in the AMP at some stage in the future.\n\n# Possible Solution\nThere is a critical need to create a more short-term value in holding YFBETA tokens in order to balance the supply\/demand equation. This will be attractive to those who are looking to invest over a shorter horizon, and those who have no confidence that some day YFBETA tokens can be redeemed for cash held in the AMP. The solution is to simply modify the payout structure of the yield:\n\n**40% of the yield goes into the Autonomous Money Pile (AMP)**\n**40% of the yield buys YFBETA tokens from Uniswap and burns them forever**\n**10% of the yield is paid out to directly to depositors**\n**5% of the yield is paid out to YFB holders.**\n**5% of the yield is reserved for gas fees**\n\nNote, the %'s above can certainly be modified if deemed necessary. The introduction of this 5% payout gives an immediate value to holding YFB tokens and a competitive landscape arises. If the total value in the vaults is significantly large, then 5% of the yield corresponds to a very high return that is worth chasing after. In the meantime, the AMP will continue to grow (albeit at a smaller rate). A new problem is created however, which is what is the incentive of adding to the vault if you just need to lock up your YFB tokens to receive that 5%? A solution to this would be to enforce a deposit : YFB ratio requirement. For instance, for every $1,000 deposited, a maximum of 1 YFB can be locked up for the purpose of earning the 5%.\n\nThis combination of short-term and long-term value creates a duality where holding the tokens gives you an immediate return that you can cash out with at any time, but you also have comfort in knowing that the tokens you are holding are steadily increasing in value due to the burn mechanic working in your favor. It is my hypothesis that the reduced AMP rate (47.5% to 40%) will be offset by having a larger Total Value Locked in the vaults. I also believe that a more optimal solution would be to also include hybrid vaults in this design with different % breakdowns and risk profiles.\n\nAdditionally, the existing emission period has a very high APY of 200%, without any risk of capital. It is likely that a longer emission period, or a non-linear release of YFBETA tokens would still create enough of an incentive to keep funds locked in the vault. For example, if the current emission period was 60 days instead of 30 days, the APY would be 100%, which is almost certainly going to keep investors locked in vaults, with the added benefit that the AMP can grow for twice as long.\n\nI think a combination of a slower emission schedule and an immediate benefit in holding YFB tokens creates price stability, and a longer term incentive to remain in vaults after emission periods are over.\n\n\n\n# TL;DR\nA vote for **Yes** means:\nWe would add an incentive to any new vaults that allows users to **optionally** stake yfB to earn a % of the vault profits. Users who choose to stake yfB for these rewards must also have a minimum amount of value locked in the vault. The profit will be shared across all users who are staking yfB in the same vault, in proportion to the amount they have staked.\n\nThe introduction of this idea converts yfB into a dividend paying token, causing immediate demand to increase the circulating supply to decrease as more yfB are staked in vaults. This is likely to lead to increased token price in the long term. \n\n\nA vote for **No** means:\nNo change to the current system and no yfB can be staked in any vaults.","protocol":"yfbeta","adapter":"default","proposer":"0xF3dca43787d77f846974BE7d75BAeE8AaB856A39","totalVotes":136,"blockNumber":10962275,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yfbeta\/proposal\/QmZDZSqYMww6QaAb5F4ZUqpUWoUkn5sMvtABL3a3MGf8vW","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1601449260}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1601794740}","startTimestamp":1601449260,"endTimestamp":1601794740,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Yes', 'No']","results":"[{'total': 3688.2566, 'choice': 0}, {'total': 0, 'choice': 1}]","events":"[]"}

Currently, a user\u2019s activity can be negative if the total rewards they\u2019ve received are less than the total value of their votes. As a result, some users have a negative influence, and therefore are unable to receive rewards. The protocol was intentionally designed to penalize users for doing a large number of low-value votes, but the existing influence algorithm is overly punitive.\n\nTherefore, the influence algorithm should be adjusted in the following ways:\n\n1. The relative weight of age should increase from 0.33 to 0.4, and the weight of activity should decrease from 0.67 to 0.6.\n2. Activity, when factored into influence, should have a minimum value of zero. This guarantees that no accounts will ever have a negative influence while ensuring accounts with low-value votes are still penalized.\n","protocol":"yup","adapter":"default","proposer":"0x4303Ddc9943D862f2B205aF468a4A786c5137E76","totalVotes":7,"blockNumber":13269668,"externalUrl":"https:\/\/snapshot.org\/#\/yup.eth\/proposal\/QmXxCyA25EixPS6wP71czFvTbtco3nRUG6Kpi8A2kRYdZ1","startTime":"{'timestamp': 1632232800}","endTime":"{'timestamp': 1632326400}","startTimestamp":1632232800,"endTimestamp":1632326400,"currentState":"closed","choices":"['Approve', 'Reject']","results":"[{'total': 693.7087, 'choice': 0}]","events":"[]"}
