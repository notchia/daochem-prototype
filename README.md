# ethdenver-buidl (name to be updated :) )
## Logistics
- Sunday 02/20 @ 7am: project submission on [DoraHacks](https://hackerlink.io/hackathon/ethdenver22/) is due!
- Sunday 02/20 @ 9:30am-1pm: project presentation
- Sunday 02/20 @ 2pm: TBD!

## Overarching questions driving our work
Are (on-chain) DAOs working right now? Are they achieving their stated goals, and are members enjoying the experience?
- What governance systems are DAO members choosing to implement?
- In what ways are DAO members participating (in measureable ways)? Does DAO member activity relate to the chosen systems?
- How satisfied are DAO members with their own experiences in the DAO and with the health/success of the DAO overall? How do these experiences relate to the chosen systems?

## #BUIDLWeek deliverable
We will collect a new dataset of on- and off-chain data on DAO governance (contextualized with some existing datasets) to build a website displaying:
- For each DAO, 
  - Smart contract parameter values chosen
  - Quantitative activity information
  - Qualitative member experience information
  - Select relations between the above
- On aggregate,
  - Distribution of smart contract parameter values chosen across all DAOs, within frameworks
  - Distribution of quantitative activity metrics across select DAOs, within frameworks
  - Conclusions drawn from qualitative member experiences across select DAOs, within framework
  - Select relations between the above, within frameworks
  - Comparison across frameworks for select concepts
## Components
### Data source selection
### Blockchain data collection: **Lucia**
- [ ] Which contract blockchain addresses are we querying?
- [ ] What TrueBlocks commands + Python post-processing will get (1) smart contract content and (2) contract-creation transaction history?
- [ ] How can we automate the process so that the data can be readily updated at a later date?
### Contextual quantitative data collection: **Fabio**
- [ ] What kind of contextual information are we collecting, and from what sources (e.g., Snapshot proposal counts, from boardroom.info's API)? 
- [ ] Which specific DAOs are we getting contextual quantitative information for?
### Contextual qualitative data collection: **Sage**
- [ ] What kind of contextual information are we collecting, and how (e.g., survey, what kinds of questions)? 
- [ ]   Type form or google forms for survey
- [ ] Which specific DAOs are we seeking contextual qualitative information for (e.g., member experiences via survey)?
- [ ]   The outreach list will be based on which DAOs have the most robust on chain data available (Sage would like a preliminary list from Lucia for the top 50-100 DAOs to reach out to)
- FOR REFERENCE, BOARDROOM DAO ONLY HAS 89 DAOS
- [ ]   large membership daos that don't necessarily have large treasury (service daos, raid guild, opolis, coordinape) social daos focused on stewardship not necessarily revenue 

- [ ] How are we reaching out to DAOs to get this?
### Blockchain data analysis: **Son + Lucia**
- [ ] What view of the data do we display for each DAO?
- [ ] What aggregate stats/conclusions can we find and display?
### Contextual quantitative data analysis: **Fabio + Son**
- [ ] What view of the data do we display for each DAO?
- [ ] What aggregate stats/conclusions can we find and display?
### Contextual qualitative data analysis: **Sage + Son**
- [ ] What view of the data do we display for each DAO?
- [ ] What aggregate stats/conclusions
### Aggregate data analysis: **Son + Lucia ( + all)**
- [ ] Can we identify any interesting relationships between the data sources within individual DAO? (to display for each DAO)
- [ ] Can we find any trends/relationships between the data sources across DAOs in aggregate? (to display in the aggregate data)
### Database setup: **Fabio**
- [ ] Store all the above data
### Front-end setup: **Fabio ( + all)**
- [ ] Display data neatly for each DAO
- [ ] Display aggregate analysis data
### Preparation for hackathon final presentation: **all**
- [ ] Write short bit describing our work for "about" page
- [ ] Draft elevator pitch
